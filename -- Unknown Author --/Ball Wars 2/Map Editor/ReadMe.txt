  The map editor lets you make your own maps for Ball Wars 2. The editor is unoptimized and can lag when making big maps. 
To play a map that you are someone else made, run Ball Wars 2, then go to the battle screen. Select "Custom Map" from the list.
An open file dialog will pop up allowing you to select your level file. When you start the match you will play on the map you chose.
Have fun!
