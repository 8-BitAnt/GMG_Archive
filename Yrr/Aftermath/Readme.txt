Story:
Mario and Toad are the lone survivors of an air strike on the Mushroom Kngdom. Toad formulates a plan to escape from the deep crater left behind. But will it work?

Controls:
Arrow keys - Move
Shift - Jump

-The save file included is the start without the cutscene. By clicking load on your first try, you can skip the cutscene. I don't recommend skipping on your first play, but I just included it to stop errors-

Known Bugs:
Sometimes the saving messes up, just click "Ignore" on the error
