--- STEEL BROADSIDES ---
	VER 2.1


game name:  steel broadsides
author: maxelliomega
game type:  shooter


About the Game:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a simple point and click game reminescent of the battleship
board game.  The controls involve simple adjustments to the angle 
and range(power).

This game only has 5 play levels and 1 boss level.  This project
took me 2 weeks to do.  I did not have the time to clean up the
code at all.  If you requested the source code for this game in
.gml format, you may not be able to easily convert it over to your
design but good luck.  Kinda messy.


Tips:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Take the time to aim your cannons before shooting.  The turn based
AI will shoot after you fire your cannons and/or send a bomber to
carpet bomb your ships.

Beware of those converted cargo ships.  They have anti-air plaque
guns that saturate the sky to knock down your bombers.  Take them
out first.

The destroyers themselves do not have anti-air defenses.  Once you
destroy its support ships, its just a matter of skill and luck to
finish it off.

Once the lead ship is destroyed, you can move on to the next level.

Save your bombers until its safe to send them against the enemy
armada.  You can send your bombers at will when its your turn.


Controls:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Shooting - 
you can adjust the spread of your salvo whether wide or
tight by increasing or decreasing it using the graphic toggle 
during the game.  A .10 on the spread will make a perfect broadside
against the hull of your target.

Turret -
You can turn your turrets all together to change its angle and 
increase or decrease the range.

Bombers -
You have a limited set of bombers available each stage to complete
it.  Some stages have move available than others.

Sound -
To turn off the bg music, press ENTER.
