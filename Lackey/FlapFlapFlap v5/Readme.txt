Objective:

Destroy all of the Xile (pyramids) to complete each stage.  The Xile will regain health when they are not being attacked and they periodically create enemies.  Sometimes destroyed Xile will drop red health squares.  Collect these to regain health.

Hints:

-Use the terrain to your advantage.  If you can get into a position where you can attack the enemy without the hitting you, all the better.

-Make good use of your lasers and bombs.  Both are useful weapons.

-Keep moving, the eyes can't track you if you move fast enough.

Story:

The Riders are a nomadic people who have always defended their corner of the universe on wing-powered vehicles called ornithopters.

Flapflapflap is a Rider scout born on the first day of the first month of the first year in the decade and named accordingly to Rider tradition.  He takes pride in his work, and has more than once defended worlds from the mechanical menace of the robot-world-being called Gvort.

Unfortunately Flapflapflap came too close to a machine ruled moon called Fthirnic Sol.  As he tried to escape the fire of the surface bases the sky turned dark with legions of robotic beings called bhutar.  Flapflapflap was forced back to the surface, where he must blind Gvort's gaze on this world by destroying the Xile, his ever watchful eyes.  If he can just destroy the Xile, then he can slip back into the skies unnoticed.  The fight will be long and tough...
