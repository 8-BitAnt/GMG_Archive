MEGABOT README FILE
===================


THANK YOU
---------


Thank You for trying Megabot. I'm sure it will provide hours of entertainment. Before diving into the game please take the time to read through this readme file for important information.


SPECIFICATIONS
--------------


Megabot was created on a Hewlett Packard PC running the Windows XP operating system:

- Pentium III
- 600 MHz
- 256 MB of RAM
- DirectX 8.1

The game runs perfectly smooth. It should run equally well on a PC with these specs:

- Pentium II
- 500 Mhz
- 128 MB of RAM
- DirectX 7.0

And it should run reasonably well on a PC with these specs:

- Pentium II
- 400 Mhz
- 64 MB of RAM
- DirectX 6.0

The game is (18.1 MB) in total size and (4.4 MB) compressed. The game should run correctly on Windows 97/98/XP/NT.


OTHER THINGS TO NOTE
--------------------


Megabot runs in "exclusive graphics mode" which means it cannot be minimized. If you wish to access windows while Megabot is running, you have to press the "windows key". Depending on the system, Megabot may or may not work properly afterwards. I have tested going back and forth to windows while running the game and it seemed fine. But it all depends on the system.

The music contained in Megabot is all in MIDI format. MIDI songs only sound as good as the computer's ability to play certain instruments and notes. Some PCs have good MIDI support some don't. In any case, I have tested it on both ends of the spectrum, and the music is still pretty good. If you don't like it, turn it off with the "-" key on the numeric keyboard.

One last thing. The game automatically saves every time you go back to the Level Select Screen. So you need not worry about this, as it is handled intrinsicly.

Please read the instruction manual contained within the game for details on button configuration and gameplay information. 


COMMENTS

I hope you enjoy playing this game. It took me 6 months of constant work and headaches to make. In the end it was all worth it.

It is not an easy game. It was intended for people who remember playing classic games like Megaman on the Nintendo Entertainment System of 1985. These were games that were fairly challenging. I wanted to recreate this experience with some of my own twists on gameplay. The game is for hardcore gamers only. It is not intended to be played and finished in 15 minutes. It is a full length "near commercial quality" game that takes days to play.

Megabot contains lots of surprises and extras, so there is lots to explore and discover. The game was made to be challenging but fun, and at the same time rewarding. Finish the game 100% and you will be in for a very cool surprise!
