HOW TO RUN
----------
Run DoF (Sharp).exe, or, if you experience problems, try DoF (Fuzzy).exe.


BASICS
-------
The Bone Lord is coming to destroy the town of Fayte in 4 months, so you and your party must spend your time wisely in order to be ready for him. Up to 4 players can participate on a single computer, training and working in town and adventuring in dungeons.

Any activity in town takes one week, and at the end of each month the party automatically heads out to a dungeon. Collect money in the dungeon so you can buy equipment and new classes at the shop, and pay for advanced training at locations to earn more stats. Dungeons also have many opportunities to increase your stats, so keep an eye out for anything unusual.

STATS
-----
STRENGTH (STR) - Affects melee and (to a lesser extent) arrow damage.
ACCURACY (ACC) - Affects chance of critical hit.
INTELLECT (INT) - Affects charge time for casting spells.
FORTITUDE (FOR) - Affects hit points.
CHARM (CHA) - Affects tie votes and other things...


COMBAT
------
Melee and ranged combat simply involve using the attack button. Different weapon types have different ranges, speeds and force values. Daggers are fast and short, while maces are slow but apply more force against their target.

You can increase your damage by hitting targets from behind, and dealing critical hits (based on accuracy). Stealth mode (Thief only) also increases damage.

Magic spells (for the Adept, Necromancer and Storm Mage) must be charged, but they have different effects depending on how long you charge them. When your intellect is high enough, you can fire the first or second level of a spell without charging.

Note that there are weapon types for each class, and if you change to a class with a different weapon type, your weapon will be replaced (you will get a partial gold refund).


ENDING
------
After 4 months are over, the bone lord arrives! Depending on whether the party defeats him or not, you will get different endings.


KNOWN ISSUES
------------
Some keyboards can only take input from a few keys at a time. If you're playing with two or more people on the same keyboard and your controls seem unresponsive, this may be the issue.

Don't forget to toggle numlock if you're using the numpad!

To skip name entry (if you want to use entirely controllers, for example), press BACK on your controller instead of start on the control entry screen.


TIPS AND TRICKS
---------------
*Knights can attack when their shield is out, making them very handy in the front lines, and a great team member.

*Bandits can't be hit by weapons or projectiles while rolling.

*Enemies stop moving before they attack. Try to get out of the way.

*As a Necromancer, release your spell while standing on a corpse to change its effect.

*The Paladin's power is much more useful in a group.

*Summoners heal a little when they return to human form. Intellect affects their damage output.

*There is a way to reduce the cost of everything in town, but only the mayor can do it.

*Tell all your friends about Dungeons of Fayte to raise your charm.

*There is a secret boss in one of the dungeons. Heed the warnings or expect to die if you choose not to escape.

*Truly worthy heroes get an ending, defeat the Bone Lord, and defeat a dungeon boss.

*You can only save one character per class, and only at the end of the game.

*The best rewards are for completion and mastery.
