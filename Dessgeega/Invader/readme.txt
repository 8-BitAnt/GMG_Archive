INVADER (revision 3) is a game by dessgeega, with music by andonuts and title
  art by persona. it was created in game maker by mark overmars, and the
  music was composed in organya maker by studio pixel.

THE ONLY SURVIVOR of her fleet, invader sammie races toward her homeworld in
  her spacecraft. but a player anxious for bonus points follows her and
  shoots her down.

  she crashes deep within a strange alien world. her ship is destroyed, but
  sammie is unharmed. her only thoughts of her partner and her beautiful
  podlings, sammie lifts her blasters and prepares for the long trip to the
  surface.
