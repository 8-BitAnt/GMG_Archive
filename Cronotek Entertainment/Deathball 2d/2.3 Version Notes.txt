Deathball 2D v2.3
Version Notes
=================

NOTE: Saved game data from previous versions are not compatible with v2.3


GENERAL:

   - The talent tree has undergone significant changes to greatly increase build diversity.
     The main focus is to remove the disconnect between shots and volleys. Now both shots
     and volleys should be viable for scoring, regardless of your talent setup.

   - The talent tree no longer has skill prerequisites. All talents on each tier will be
     available as long as you spend enough points to reach them.

   - Increased the number of talent points available to spend from 21 to 26. Because of
     this, Tier 5 talents have had their point requirements increased from 20 to 25.

   - Increased the player's shot charge rate by approximately 20%.

   - Increased the power of the player's shots and instant shots by approximately 10%.

   - Increased the power of the player's volleys by approximately 3%.
