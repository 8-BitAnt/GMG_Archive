2. Introduction & Features

Welcome to Evolites, a simple life simulation where you indirectly control the fates of a countless number of tiny, unique creatures, known as Evolites. As the Evolites evolve naturally, various tools are at your disposal to save, destroy, create, and interact with them. You may let things run their course, or you may directly intervene, and make sure that only your chosen strain of Evolites survives!

Partially inspired by the opening sequence of the upcoming game Spore, and partially a pet project that just seemed fun to make, Evolites was created to interest, entertain, and relax all types of gamers, casual and up. The game features a mouse-only control setup, and large, colorful graphics. Online functionality via the Reflect Acocunt System is also built-in, and a handful of options put you at full control of how you want to play the game.




3. Controls

Controlling the game is simple, especially if you have a wheel mouse. If you do not use a wheel mouse, the up and down arrows may be substituted at the necessary times.

LEFT MOUSE - Click to open menu boxes, press buttons, select Evolites, and activate selected tools. Click and drag Evolites from the catalog to copy them, save them, or upload them

RIGHT MOUSE - Click to deselect Evolites or delete Evolites from the catalog

MOUSE WHEEL / UP & DOWN ARROW KEYS - Interact with variable buttons or attract the selected Evolite to the current mouse location

F1 - Restart the game (warning: all unsaved data will be lost)
