<strong>Shatter</strong><br><br>

This game doesn't have any kind of plot or story. Your goal is to blow up as many things that move before you explode. And things that don't move. Collect the letters to improve your firing rate, firing amount, ship speed, and homing lasers.<br><br>

<strong>Controls</strong><br>
Arrow Keys- Move around<br>
Space (held)- Fire<br>
Shift+Space- Special weapon<br>
Escape- Pause/Quit<br><br>

<strong>Changing the music</strong><br>
While the option is there in-game to turn the music on and off, there is also a way to choose the song that is played during gameplay. Place any mp3 file in the same directory as shatter (the game must be unzipped) and name it shatter.mp3. Shatter.mp3 will be played as the game's music, if it exists. If no file is found, the default music will play.<br><br>

<strong>Unlocking the third ship</strong><br>
To make the third ship available permanently, reach 80000 points on either difficulty setting using either ship.<br><br>

<strong>the Command Prompt</strong><br>
The options most people care to change are available normally through the options menu, but there are a few other things you can do by typing one of the following commands into the prompt (which is accessible via the options menu):<br>
commands - gives a list of valid commands.<br>
debug - toggles debug mode on and off, which shows some extra performance stats during the game<br>
alpha - turns on and off the use of alpha rendering during the game, which can slow it down if enabled on some older computers. This feature is on by default.<br>
cheat ??? - if you think you know a cheat to this game, replace the ??? with the correct word and try it in the command prompt. No indication will be given as to whether your cheat was correct or not.<br>
quit - same as the escape key: returns to the main menu.
