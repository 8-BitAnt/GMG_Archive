if you have an AZERTY Keyboard,
Please do the following:

-Open gamesettings.ini

-change 'keyboard=0' into 'keyboard=1'

-save the changes.


NOTE:
By doing this, all 'Z' commands in the game are now operational by pressing 'W' instead.
This will mean that if the game says 'press z' instead you will need to press 'W'
I know it's confusing, blame the Keyboard companies :P.
