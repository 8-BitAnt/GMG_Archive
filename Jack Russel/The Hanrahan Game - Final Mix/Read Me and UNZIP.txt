This file must be unzipped for the game to function fully.

Legal Info:
The game is free. You can play it all you want without giving me any money or bribes. 

You may not modify the game, sell the game, or use graphics from the game without my permission. If you do I will be very cross.

The game has various sound files which I collected from sites, these sources are in a seperate readme in this folder. These sounds were freeware. 

A final note just to say that this game was made with Game Maker, which is a programme produced by Mark Overmars. (www.gamemaker.nl)
