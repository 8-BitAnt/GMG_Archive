Notes
------

The server application is included with the game client in this release,
so you do not need to seperately download it. See the readme_server.txt 
for more information about running a server. See the changelist.txt for

Enjoy!

V - FAQ / Troubleshooting
--------------------

I experience low FPS:
                - Try disabling some of the performance related options in the game options menu (especially 'Use 3D').
                - Close down and minimise all unnecessary background applications.
                - Run the game in fullscreen (resolution mode works best).
                - V-sync can drain performance, so try turning it off.

I experience multiplayer lag:
                - Your internet connection may be too slow, 512k at least is recommended.
                - The host server may be hosted in a distant location, so you have a high ping. Try another server.
                - The host server may have a slow connection. Try another server.
                - Your router/firewall/antivirus might be blocking connection.
                - Close down all bandwidth draining applications (i.e. downloads, torrents, messenger clients etc).

I experience screen tearing:
                - Try enabling V-sync in the game options menu.

I can't log in to Reflect games:
                - Reflect games may be experiencing down time, so try again later.
                - You may have connection issues, i.e. your router/firewall/antivirus is blocking connection.

I can't join a LAN server:
                - Use the IP connect and enter the correct LAN IP of the host machine.

I lost my achievements:
                - Copy the achievements file '/Data/Achievements/ach_Username' from your old copy of Adrenaline to your new one.
                
My antivirus says that Adrenaline is a virus:
                - This is a false positive, Adrenaline never has or ever will contain any virus or malware!

Bots do not work properly on map <x>:
                - Unfortunately bots may have problems navigating on maps where most walls are not aligned to a 64x64 (wall size) grid.
                  This is unavoidable, so if you're a map maker make sure of that, otherwise bug the map maker to fix it!
