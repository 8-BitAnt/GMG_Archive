Introduction
------------

Thanks for downloading Globules! Globules is an action-based strategy game that plays out like tug-of-war. The player must break the enemy's defences and eventually overwhelm him to win the round. This requires resource management, effective placement of battle structures, good timing and reflexes. Globules features a single player skirmish mode and multiplayer functionality over LAN or online for 2 players.

Goal
----

Your goal in Globules is to destroy all of your enemy's buildings. You do this by building your own structures, each with unique uses and attributes. You can choose to build resource, defensive, or offensive structures. You can also cast 'Powers', once they have recharged, by clicking on them. You lose if the enemy destroys all of your buildings!
