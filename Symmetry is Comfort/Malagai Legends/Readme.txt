I. Intro 

It has been twenty years since the original Malagai for the Atari 2600
system was released by Answer Software.  This is Symmetry is Comfort's
tribute to such a relatively unknown classic.

Malagai Legends is the first of our Atari 2600 remakes.  We had
intended to be as faithful to the original as possible, yet add in a
few new features.  The result was a much faster and maybe even more
playable version of Malagai.  We also wanted to mention that this is
a fan creation and we are no part of the original crew (Answer 
Software) which had created the original Malagai game.

II. How to Begin

To start a game, open the .exe and wait for the intro to end.  At the
main screen, you have the option of three difficulties: Easy, Moderate,
and Hard.  To access these, you must type in the number that 
corresponds to the difficulty level: 1 being Easy, 2 being Moderate, 
and 3 being Hard.  Once you do this, hit ENTER and the game will begin.
However, your first time playing Malagai Legends will leave you only
with Easy Mode as Moderate and Hard must be unlocked.  To unlock
Moderate Mode, you must reach 900 points in Easy Mode.  To unlock Hard
Mode, you must reach 900 points in Moderate Mode. 

Malagai Difficulty Levels

Easy:
All three Malagai have different shapes and colors.

Moderate:
All three Malagai have the same shape but different colors.

Hard:
All three Malagai are the same shape and same color!

After reaching 900 points in Hard Mode, you will view a special ending.  

The game automatically saves your progress once you die, so if you 
decide to take a break, you can start the game up later with 
everything you had already unlocked available.

III. Gameplay

(Note: The Gameplay is slightly different than that of Malagai.)

You start out in the safe zone.

Observe the three Malagai displayed above the maze. The leftmost figure 
indicates which Malagai has the first key. The center figure indicates 
who has the second key, and the rightmost figure indicates who has the 
third and final key.

You must make contact with the Malagai you wish to steal a key from
and get to the airlock.  You do this three times to proceed to the
next starbase.  Unlike the original, the only way to anger the Malagai
is to stay away from your cell for too long.  Harrington Crag has
learned a few new tricks to steal keys without their knowledge of it.

You have to hurry because when the timer reaches zero, the Malagai will
become angry and attempt to find and destroy you!  Get to the 
safe zone at the bottom of the screen to regain your timer and allow 
the Malagai to resume their helpless wandering.

Each time you exit from the third (blue) starbase level you obtain an 
additional crew member.  There is a maximum of three lives.

Game is over when all your crew members have been destroyed by the 
Malagai.

GOOD LUCK
