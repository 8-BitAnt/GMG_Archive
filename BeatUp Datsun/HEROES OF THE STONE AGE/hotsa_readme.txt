HEROES OF THE STONE AGE
0.92b public beta 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOME NOTES:

INSTALLATION:
Place all the files of the zip in a directory on your hard drive and run
"hotsa.exe".

SOUND:
The curent version of HOTSA doesnt have any sounds or music, so this
is not a bug... Maybe a later version will have it... If you feel 
like composing some original MIDI tunes or MODS we'd be more than
happy. You can contact us at beatupdatsun@hotmail.com

CONTROLS:
Arrow keys: Move/Jump
Space: Use weapon (if you have one)
Control: Change Weapon (if you have more than one)
Escape: Return to main menu

LANGUAGE:
To change the language of HOTSA simply open "hotsa.ini" with your 
notepad/text editor and follow the instructions there.

SAVING:
Once you save a game, the game will create a folder called \savegames
wherever the .exe. file is located.

BUGS:
There will be many for sure. Please feel free to email us about them.
We will also put an updated buglist on our website. Any comments and 
ideas are welcome as well.
