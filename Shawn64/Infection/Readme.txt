Controls:
arrows - move
left or right off a wall wall-jumps (very handy)
right click - grenade
left click - machine gun
esc - go to menu
enter - skip scene

Tip 1:  Do not just jump into the enemy and sit there shooting and say ooooh this is too hard!  Go up the the enemy and let it chase you backwards and shoot like crazy.  There is noway you can beat the game without coming up with a strategy and getting to know the levels.  Every level can be beaten without getting hit once.  It just takes some time to get good

Tip 2:  There are 2 save points in the game.  The first one doesnt come till level 4-1.  I know that is a big gap but it makes it so its not an easy game which alot of save points would do.  The save points restore your health and give you an extra life.  You can only have 1 saved game at a time which is fine.

Tip 3:  Dont give up.
