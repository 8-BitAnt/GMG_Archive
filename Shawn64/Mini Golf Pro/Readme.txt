When it is your turn move the mouse so the arrow on your ball is aimed where you want it to move.  Hold the left mouse button to charge your shot.  If you hold it too long the charge will reset.  Release the left mouse button and watch your ball fly!  


::::::::::::::::::::Strategy:::::::::::::::::::
Obstacles in the courses can be used to your advantage.  Hitting a mine in the right spot can cause a bad shot to turn out pretty good.  Try to find the best shot angle in every hole. Every hole has a possible hole in one shot.  Some may be obvious, some might not be, and some might take luck.  

When in the gravity chamber you can try two approaches.  You can risky and shoot long shots that may get you pretty far up.  That approach usually results in a fall that can really hurt your score. Another approach is to take nice and easy advancements up the tower.  There is always something you can shoot to next.  


::::::::::::::::::::Playing Online:::::::::::::::::::
To set up a TCP/IP online game, click the online button on the menu.  You will be asked to host a game or to join a game.  If you join be sure to type the ip of the host’s computer when asked to.

During game play when it’s not your turn you can hold control and push 1-9 to taunt your opponents.

If a level somehow has an error and nobody can hit the host can push f2 to reset the level.



::::::::::::::::::::Questions:::::::::::::::::::

Q - I get an error message when I load the game
A - Most error messages on the loading screen are due to low memory.  Try restarting your computer. If that does not work contact Webmaster@Shawn64.com for help.

Q - Why does the game run so slow?
A - First of all you should look to see what your game speed is while you’re playing on a hole.  It shows the fps in the bottom right hand corner.  It should be 30.  If it is lower it is probably due to your graphics card.  Get a faster one if it’s slow.  Also you may want to try switching to 16bit color on the menu. For some people this can cause dramatic results in the fps.

Q - Why does the high score table not show up?
A - You need to be online to take advantage of the score tables.

Q - Why do the other player’s balls lag so bad while Online?
A - This is mainly due to a different in computer speeds.  If one players ball keeps appearing to lag backwards to where it has already been that person may be running the game slower than you.  If you see a ball skip ahead farther the other person may run the game faster.

Q - Something strange has happened while playing online.  Nobody can hit!
A - This is most likely due to the turns getting off on one players computer.  This is rare but can be caused by bad lag in certain situations.  If you are the host you can restart a room by pushing f2.  Use this button only in emergencies
