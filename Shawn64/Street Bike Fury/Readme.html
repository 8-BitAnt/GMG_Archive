<b>---HOW TO PLAY---</b><br>
The goal of this game is to STAY ALIVE and ESCAPE to the end of the 14 waves!  <br>
You are armed with 3 weapons.<br>
<br>
<b>Machine Gun</b> - Great for multiple targets and missiles coming at you from different directions<br>
<b>Shotgun</b> - Good for shooting out more powerful enemies quicker<br>
<b>Rocket Launcher</b> - Takes out helicopters, Jetpack guys, and much more<br>
<br>
You will run into a few power-ups along the way too.<br>
<br>
<b>Flip Power-up</b> - Makes you light up yellow and you can spin twice as fast to get more flips.<br>
<b>Fire Boost Power-up</b> - Hit this for a 50-50 chance to receive a power-up that lets you go really fast.  To use it hold right click.  You will see an icon at the top left of the screen if you have this item<br>
<b>Health Power-up</b> - Rolls along the ground after each wave<br>
<br>
You will have a hard time making it very far unless you understand a few TIPS<br>
<br>
<b>---TIPS---</b><br>
1. Use your rockets on the helicopter as soon as you see it.  <br>
2. Do flips every time you get a chance to regain health.<br>
3. Take out chainsaw or Flamethrower guys quickly.  They drain your health fast.<br>
4. Killing enemies upside down gives you an extra bonus.<br>
5. Blue Jetpack guys CAN be helpful if you don't kill them...<br>
6. If you’re getting hurt by a chainsaw guy, PUSH DOWN.  It will kill him instantly.<br>
7. Shoot below you when you’re falling so you don't fall on an enemy and get hurt.<br>
8. DONT let the jetpack guys follow you after the Flying mode parts.  Shoot them down quick with your rocket launcher.<br>
<br>
