BAD HOMBRES BEWARE
a tough customer goes by the handle of calamity annie has decided she's
had enough of the new west and has gone to find her fortune in the place
where it all began - the old west. if she keeps her aim true, she might find
love, adventure, and more than her share of trouble.


ANNIE GET YOUR GUN
the first time you play, the old prospector, good prospects, will give you a
run through how the game works. if you ain't got time to lend an old man an
ear, here's how to keep yourself alive in the old west.

calamity annie is entirely mouse-driven. at the beginning of each showdown,
you'll be asked to holster your gun (this is a fair fight, after all). to do
so, move your mouse cursor over the blinking box marked "HOLSTER" at the
bottom of the window. your mouse is your pistol, remember that.

now get ready! in a few moments - maybe the blink of an eye, maybe the time
it takes for a drop of sweat to run down a forehead - your foe's gonna call
"DRAW!", and you'll have a short period of time to lift your pistol, aim at
that hombre, and pull the trigger - the left button on your mouse.

as you work your way through the ranks and face more skilled hombres, you'll
have less and less time to draw your gun and shoot before the hombre gets the
drop on you. get shot three times and your adventure's over, marked by the
cards at the top of the window. there might be more cards to be had if you
can wrangle up enough reward money.

you'll have to teach twenty hombres who's boss before your high noon showdown
with the five baddest hombres in the land. and if you can best them, well,
there may be someone else who wants a piece of you.


PAUSING THE GAME
if you want to take a breather, just click on another window or on annie's
titlebar. the game will pause and wait until you return and click on the
"paused" button. you can't pause the game during a shootout or bonus scene,
only on the black screen between shootouts. if you click away at any other
time, the game will pause once it gets back to this screen.


SAVE ME A PLACE
calamity annie keeps track of your highest score and as well as your progress
within the game's story. you can quit to the title at any time by hitting the
esc key twice, or quit the game instantly by clicking the x button in the
corner. your score (should it be your highest) won't be recorded if you do
this - you need to play a full game, to the finish, in order to claim a high
score. however, your story data will always be saved when you quit the game.

to clear either your high score or your story progress, click on the "data
options" icon on the title screen. (this icon won't be there the first time
you start up the game.) click the relevant skull twice (once to wake it, then
again to confirm) and the data will be reset.

this is also the screen where you'll enter a secret password, should you know
one.


ANNIE ON MY MIND
it's been a long two months! i started work on annie shortly after i was
kicked out of videogame school for asking too many questions. i was still in
texas - little town called "plainold" - when i began building the game. a
month later, in new york, i finished her.

i owe a lot to all the people who've helped me during this difficult time.
my family, who were there when the school closed their doors on me. my friend
and comrade matt williamson, who called me every night the week they kicked
me out to make sure i was alright.

most of all i'm thankful to my slut, who stood by me through six months
wasted in a faraway land, through no end of battles, through countless miles,
and through two moves across the country. she was the future that, sometimes,
i needed to remember.

talking heads was played incessantly during the development of this game.

measure of my gratitude:
