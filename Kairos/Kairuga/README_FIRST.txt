Be sure to read this or else you won't understand the game.

Note: You won't beat this game on your first try. The game is largely about memorization,
so you'll be playing quite a while before you master the patterns. 
And don't expect this to be like the real Ikaruga, I didn't want to clone it. Gameplay is 
slightly different, you will notice. The homing lasers also do not exactly work the same way,
mostly because I did not replicate it.

    * DirectX 8 compatible graphics card with at least 32MB of video memory, or integrated card

The main point of Kairuga is to achieve the highest score possible.
There are a plethora of ways to add to your score;

1. Kill an enemy, boss, or parts of an enemy.
2. Absorb same-colored bullets.
3. Chaining enemies.

1. You have 2 polarities to switch to: Red and Blue.
Your enemies are all either red or blue.
If you shoot a red enemy with a red shot, you do normal damage to it.
If you shoot a red enemy with a blue shot, you do double the normal damage.
It's the same vice versa, colorwise.
Some enemies have parts, so sometimes you may have to destroy these parts
if you want to achieve a "chain". Look at number 3 for more about
"chaining".

2. You can absorb bullets of the same polarity, or color as your ship.
So if a red enemy shoots a red bullet, and you happen to be the red polarity,
you can absorb it for points, and to add to your charge meter.
It takes 10 regular bullets to fill up 1/12 of your charge meter.
When you think you have enough for an adequate homing discharge, press C, 
And you will fire the amount of homing missiles equal to the amount of the 
charge meter you have filled up.

3. 

"Chaining" is hitting 3 same colored enemies in a row, therefore achieving a chain.
However, if you consistently hit 3 enemies (or achieve 1 chain, as we'll say from now on)
your bonus chain points double up.
For example, you achieve your first chain. You get 100 points.
You chain again. Your points doubles to +200, and your max chain amount is now 2.
You chain again. Your points double to +400, your max chain is 3.
Chain again, points double to +800, max chain is 4.
Chain yet again, points double to +1600 max chain = 5.
... And it goes on. Your chain score bonus can only go up to +25600 before stopping there.
If you break your 3 enemy chain, like hitting 2 reds and then 1 blue,
You break your chaining run. Your chain amount goes down to zero (although your max chain 
was still the highest chain you got before) and your bonus starts out at 100 again.

~Incompatibility with foreign keyboards (foreign as in non-english.) (Should be fixed)


If you encounter any problems while playing this game, such as bugs, errors,
graphic malfunction, extreme slowdown, etc. First check the original spot where
you obtained this game from to see if you meet the system requirements.
If you do, and there are major problems, do not hesitate to post at the forums of
where this game was found. Other than that, I will not be fixing any minor bugs (if they exist.)

Thanks, and I hope you enjoy Kairuga as much as I enjoyed making it.

History:

~Updated Kairuga to v.1.4 (final release) engine changed for Windows Vista compatibility 
and speed changes. Also full screen mode stretches the screen ratio instead of the same screen.

~Versions 1.2, 1.25, 1.3, 1.35 were all minor bug fixes.

~Updated Kairuga to v.1.1, music out of sync (depends on player's graphics speed)
Fixed, first music track ends at Boss Warning. Customizable controls added.

~Changed text to add controls for main menu.

~Fixed sound issues, but some people may have problems with FMOD altogether.
