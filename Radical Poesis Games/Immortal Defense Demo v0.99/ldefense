Eh? Newcomer--#
Not many have the courage to ascend to our level: the level of pathspace defense.  You will still be disoriented from the conversion: let me explain.#
The Bavakh are invading your home planet, Dukis.  They are using phasewarp travel, which allows their ships to bypass relativity and strike across great distances.  Though a powerful weapon, it's been countered by a higher dimension still: pathspace, which you and I inhabit.#  
They see only the lines; we see the shapes.  To the Bavakh, we are ghosts, but our attacks are not.#
Practice is the best demonstration.  A Bavakh fleet is attacking an outpost of your world through phasewarp.  Move your mouse to fire automatically at the nearest ship within range.#
We are ghosts, but the situation is very real.  Lives will be lost if the Bavakh reach the end of the path.  Too many lives lost, and we have failed.  So do not disappoint, newcomer--and maybe they will let you return to your world one day--

You have a limited appreciation for path defense, I see.  You may become something promising yet.  But you will never equal me--Pul Wat Aa, path defender of the great planet Oss.#
You have not heard of me?  I knew that your planet was isolated, newcomer--but not to have heard of Aa, the great hero of Oss?#
No matter--you'll learn of Aa's greatness soon enough.  I will bestow you with wisdom: you can right-click to charge up a powerful attack, and then click again to release it.  So just fire your little shots, newcomer--watch and learn--and witness the power of Aa's will made manifest!

Hello.  I am a Fear Point.  I am you.#
Or rather, I am a part of your will used to assist you in path defense.  You can use me to cover certain areas of the path while you focus your attention elsewhere.  I damage invaders, plus I slow them down to give us both more time to stop them.  I can even lower enemy defenses, or cancel any special abilities they may have.  I'm useful, aren't I?#
Just select my image in the Point Palette, hold the mouse button down in the location where you want to place me, wait until I've charged up, then release.  Also useful, isn't it?#
You'll need cache to place me.  You earn cache by destroying invaders.  Since it looks like you already have some from your previous fights, why not learn how to use me right now?  If you make good use of me, you might be able to place more of me as your mission goes on--#  
When you are satisfied with my positioning, press the spacebar or click START to begin the battle.  The Bavakh are coming again--

The Bavakh are threatening a jump gate two systems away from Dukis.  If they destroy it, they'll be able to phasewarp right into Dukis space.  Don't let them!#  
Know a new secret: if you click on an enemy, all of your Points will attempt to target that enemy.  See how effective your Fear Points can be!

Fear can only get you so far--and that's where I--the Courage Point--come in!#
I do much more damage than the Fear Point, and have a much longer range!  Why wouldn't you use as many of me as possible?#
There's phasewarp activity on the supply lines in an outlying sector of the Bavakh empire--let's bring the battle to the Bavakh!

You understand fear, and you understand courage.  What you need, though, is precision.  You need me--the mathematical aspect of your will.  The Ortho Point.#
I fire at ninety-degree angles, but cannot fire on the diagonals.  This should help you decide where to place me.#
Also: have you noticed yet that you can upgrade your points?  It costs more cache, of course, but you'll get a much more effective point as a result.  To upgrade, click and hold the left mouse button on a point until the upgrade is charged, then release.  One upgraded point can be worth many smaller points--it's simple math.#
Did Aa not tell you this?#

Yet there is more to do before you can return home.  The Bavakh have noticed your attacks on their outlying systems.  They're preparing to retaliate against your home planet of Dukis.  Even now their ships gather at their staging ground.#
Let us fight them off together.  Keep out of my way and use what you know--or perhaps you won't have a home to return to at all!

I appreciate your efforts, newcomer--amateurish as they are.#
Let me share with you one of my secrets.  The Cut Point--the Point of total ruthlessness--fires a spiral spread of bullets around itself.  It does a great deal of damage, but only if the invaders drift too close to it.  So perhaps your great instincts suggest where to place this--near the path, correct?  Perhaps in loops or at corners, correct?#
There are more uses for my great weapon, as well.  For example, you might try holding your charge attack near them--#
Here is a portion of space where the Bavakh are known to travel.  Why not learn to use Aa's great gift?

How did they find the time to develop it?  In the two years you've spent in pathspace, of course.  Does it seem like that long, newcomer, that we have been together?  Do you miss your crude flesh?#
This ship--the Jumper--is designed to maximize speed along the paths and to burst through your lines of defense.  Do not let it through!

Whenever I destroy an invader, I gain in attack strength.  Early on, I'll find it difficult to fight effectively without some support.  But after I've gotten some experience, you may find me the greatest in your point arsenal.#
I am the part of you that has allowed you to thrive here in pathspace, to learn to live and thrive without your body.  You are a type of Pride Point yourself.

Nothing can survive alone.  Would you have lasted in pathspace without the support of Aa?  Would you have been driven to become the first path defender from Dukis without the support of--someone else?#

I have been occupied with matters on Oss for a year, newcomer--and I see that you have developed many new components in your arsenal!  What have you been occupying yourself with, fighting on the Borderlands?  What dark new thoughts have come?#
There is no time for more reflection now!  The Bavakh offense is pushing forward again, this time with a new craft--the Squalid.  These ships will regenerate damage when attacked.  Yet another measure of defense against the great "ghost of phase space", no doubt?  You are making my job more difficult--#
But the great Aa will come to your aid yet again by offering you his greatest weapon yet--the Strategist Point, the integration of your will.  Whenever you target an invader, the Strategist Point will fire.  It will do a certain percentage of damage to the enemy, and it will also lower his defense.  So use your Strategist Points effectively against the Bavakh--and you will yet see victory!

If we are victorious, ghost of phase space, it will end the Bavakh War!  And you, ghost, will return to your homeworld and receive a hero's welcome!#

Let's find out!  We Raberata have constructed a simulator that'll allow you to fight an endless supply of enemy drones.  They'll keep attacking you no matter what happens, and they'll keep getting stronger.#

Our victory at Dukis was perhaps--prematurely declared.  All we did, it seems, is to sow more chaos in the Bavakh Empire--chaos that has allowed the Brothers Bavakh, Crosh and Ducrosh, to take control.  I know nothing about them, save that they have created a new war machine--one aimed at the great planet of Oss!#
Do they not know the might of the great Aa?  Have they forgotten the two hundred years that I have been in pathspace, guarding my great world against all assault?  Do they not think of me as highly and fearfully as they do of you--oh Great Ghost?#
But to my side!  Do for Oss, Ghost, what I did for Dukis!  And Aa will give you his blessing--

#Up to this time, reason alone has guided you.  But I am something beyond reason--I am your next evolution--

You have fought tolerably.  It is time for the Great Aa to help you achieve your ultimate victory.
#The Bavakh fleet is approaching the Dukis Jump Gate.  One of the Brothers Bavakh--Crosh--is accompanying the fleet.  More to the point--he is the fleet.  He is something more than most Bavakh--something terrifying--
#You understand what this means, don't you?  Destroy the Bavakh leader and you'll have destroyed their government!  You'll have saved your pitiful little world!
#Where is the other brother, you ask?  Leave that to the great Aa!  With His all-seeing eyes, Aa will watch all of the other hyperspace approaches and defeat the brother Ducrosh with a swipe of my all-destroying hand.  Aa will save you from your own limitations!  Aa is ubiquitous!  Aa is all-powerful!  Aa is God!

So you have defeated one of the Brothers Bavakh.  How good of you.  But the other brother still lives, you've noticed?
#That's because the great Aa allowed it.
#Please understand--I do this in self-defense!  They were too strong--they have a planet-killer bomb!  They would have used it on Oss!  So I wrote them a message in the sky, a message that they read.  I offered a bargain.  Instead of the million dead we would leave them, I would allow them to take a far richer world than Oss--Dukis--for the cost of only a hundred thousand.
#Even now Ducrosh approaches your atmosphere with the planet-killer bomb.  Do not hinder him!  It will be painless.  He will kill your daughter, killing your pain, and he will turn your body to dust, ending your existence in pathspace.
#If you move to interfere--know that the great Aa will prevent it!

This is Jamesh.  I see you've come back.
#We all heard about what Pul Wat Aa did to you.  I don't want to get involved--I don't want my homeworld burning either.
#But I did set up a new Endless training course for you.  You can use the new skills you've developed, and you'll see some of the new enemies you encountered.  Destroy them all, survive for as long as you can--it'll make you feel better.  And it'll get you ready to take your revenge--
