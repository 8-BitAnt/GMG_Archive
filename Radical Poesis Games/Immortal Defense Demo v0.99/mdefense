Do you like challenges?  These are the challenge levels.  And I'm your host -- me, Jamesh!#
Here's how these work.  If you manage to get through a challenge level, you'll recieve a medal.  These medals aren't just for show either--they often enhance your abilities in the normal game.#
For instance, if you manage to pass this level, you'll recieve the Bright Cursor, and the attack power of your normal attack will be 15% higher--for all the levels, challenge and normal.  It will also change the color of your cursor to a brighter green!  Other medals have different effects.  If you collect them all, the game will be much easier.#
Unlocking these levels depends on how you play--for instance, this level was unlocked simply by finishing the first campaign.  But other levels have more arcane requirements--experiment!
But I'm not going to just hand you those medals!  They're just bits of tin--mere symbols of your achievement.  It's that which will increase your powers.  This challenge is tricky--you'll have to pass the level without any points to place at all.
