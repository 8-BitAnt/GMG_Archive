By this time you should already have your zip program open.  Now to play the game you will need to extract all of these files to the same place (ie desktop).

In WinZip:
select "Action" at the top and tick "All Files".  Lastly, choose a destination, and click extract.  The game should now be playable in the "Goat Bean Golf 2005" folder located where you extracted the files.

In anyother zip archive programs you may have, just make sure you extract ALL of the files to the same place.
