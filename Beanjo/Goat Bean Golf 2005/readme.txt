I. About


The Goat Bean Golf 2005 creation process started back in March 2004 as sort of a side/test project, but over time became my main project; the game was released in late December of 2004. It was a slow and painfully boring creation process, with months on end skipped due to lack interest :) It is a golf game after all! Mini-golf games have always been fun for me, so I thought it would be fun to make my own. I just hope it is enjoyable for you to play. :) 



What program did you use to create this game?
Game Maker. Amazing program, you should try it if you haven't already.

So, what's with the "2005"?
No there isn't a 2004 or 2003; this is actually the first game I've created in 2 years, and the first "real" game I've ever created.

Will there be a 2006!?
Probably not. I have a few ideas, but I don't know yet. If you enjoy this version, and would like to play more, clicking the advertisements on the bottom of the pages at goatbean.com every time you visit would increase the chances. Hey, it's a free game! :) 

Poonta?
Yes!

III. Trouble Shooting and Help



-I can't submit my levels!
Either the host is down, or you need to re-download "settings.ini" which should be available on http://www.goatbean.com's Goat Bean Golf 2005 page.

-Why isn't my level on the level web page?
It's sooo bad that it would be a crime to allow someone else to download, or the levels page hasn't been updated yet.

-I want credit for my level!!
Skip a few lines from the bottom and write your name.

-Why can't I submit my scores?
You more than likely aren't online. If you're talking about the money submission, you need 1000 more than the previous submission for it to work.

-The game won't run.
You're crazy, or not on a Windows computer.

-I can't get my course to work.
Make sure you named the levels correctly, you course folder is in the user_courses folder and you typed its name in correctly when loading it. For more information, there is a help file in the user courses folder.

-I can't read the text at the bottom of the screen.
This is because of your resolution. Try Selecting fulls creen in the options menu or change your monitor's resolution.
If you find any other problems with the game please e-mail me.

Help!

-I'm horrible and can't win any money.
Keep practicing, or ask your friends for the cheats, cheater. The key to being decent at this game is planning out your shot beforehand. You'll get better as you play.
