These are where the user courses are stored.
Simply drag and drop the level you would like, that was created in "user_levels" folder here.
Name the 1st hole "1.txt", second "2.txt"...and so on.  The max is 18, but fewer is allowed as well.

To load the user course simply type its folder's name when you go to load a course.
