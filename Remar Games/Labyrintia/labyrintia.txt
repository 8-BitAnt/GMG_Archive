LABYRINTIA

Design, code, graphics: Daniel Remar



Mostly a test of 3D collisions and platforming, this game will be extremely disorienting (and possibly nauseating) for those who're not familiar with first-person games controlled with mouse+WASD. The levels are basically huge spatial excercises. I tried making it easier to understand where to go next, but some jumps are very hard to perform, requiring you to curve around walls in mid-air and more.

Remember to use the flag - it's a checkpoint you can place on solid ground. It lets you experiment more with where you can jump, or fall off a mountain without having to climb back up.

The X-Ray (hold Spacebar) is very useful in locating items.

The goal sequence is particularly interesting on large open levels. The concept of the "polygon tornado" was shamelessly stolen from MDK.

There is an even weirder version of this game where you can flip the entire world 90 degrees along any axis. I never got around to building any levels for that version, since they are incredibly hard to make, not to mention solve!
