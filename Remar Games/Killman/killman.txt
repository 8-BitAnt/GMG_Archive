KILLMAN MASTER

Design, code, graphics: Daniel Remar
Music: Chris Laviolette AKA Captain Goodnight
Sound effects from Doom, Unreal Tournament and Death Drome



Like Hero, the tongue-in-cheek Killman was originally made in Klik'n'Play around 2004, then remade in Game Maker using drag and drop code and a heavily modified platform game example. It was enhanced up to this "Master" version, with original retro Doom-like music by Captain Goodnight. It's one of my first Game Maker games.

Iji was originally a direct sequel to this game - there are many similarities, from gameplay to graphical effects. To get the absolute highest rank, you need a lot of skill, planning and dedication. It's about equally difficult in both level A and B. The game will tell you how to get a better rank when you beat it.

FAQ

Q: Why is the music MIDI but encoded as MP3?
A: Probably because the computer I used while making the Master version couldn't play MIDIs properly.
