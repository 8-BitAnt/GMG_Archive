Hyper Princess Pitch

This game has two executable files, compiled in different versions of Game Maker, but both have the same content. If one of them doesn't work or slows down on your system, please try the other. There's an in-game option to display the framerate (40 is normal, 20 during intentionally slowed boss explosions).

The GM7 version has less accurate sound and graphics handling, but is more likely to work well with Windows Vista and 7.

WINE users: the GM5 version uses DirectDraw, while the GM7 version uses Direct3D. Both versions use DirectX. Try playing the game windowed for best results.


VERSION 1.5 (22 November 2015)
------------------------------
-New sprite splitting death effect for the rainbow weapon and its upgraded forms. For stylistic reasons, large enemies explode instead of being split.
-An unused "extra life" voice clip was implemented in the stage clear screen.
-Ice particles from destroyed enemies are slightly brighter.
-The powerup cheat can now give you the Hyper X, Hyper Y and Hyper Z powerups.
-An option lets you toggle between version 1.5 and 1.4 of the game if you prefer the old style special effects, clear screen voice clips and cheat code behaviour.


VERSION 1.4 (30 March 2014)
---------------------------
-Removed debug keys.
-As a nod to Tseralith's no-damage TAS, Pitch wears a blindfold on reallyjoel's mom difficulty.
-Small fixes.


VERSION 1.3 (19 June 2013)
--------------------------
-Made the secret room entrance clearly visible when your highest score is over 250000.
-The secret difficulty doesn't scale enemy HP anymore (does it matter?).


VERSION 1.2 (28 January 2012)
-----------------------------
-Fixed the "90 rooms of action" typo; it now says 70 rooms.
-Fixed a bug with the number of options on the difficulty selection screen.
-Added an "unbind all" option to the gamepad screen.
-Added Edward Morgan, winner of the secret room competition during the Iji run at Awesome Games Done Quick 2012 at www.speeddemosarchive.com


VERSION 1.1 (3 December 2011)
-----------------------------
-The game now features a windowed scaling option.
-The GM7 version now scales the window correctly.
-It is now possible to scale the window by clicking and dragging the corner in the GM7 version.
-The game now loads alternate fire and change keys correctly.
-You can now use alternate letter keys for movement (such as WASD). Note that your keyboard may not be able to press more than two or three letter keys at the same time.
-The Xbox 360 D-pad and other POV input is now automatically mapped as movement controls.
-Fixed spawner arrow position for the Toy Train enemy.
-Fixed the second outdoor area in Stage 1 not being snowy, and made it slightly easier to compensate.
-Fixed not being able to change weapons during door transitions using a gamepad.
-Not changed: The game will not be redesigned for twin-stick firing mode - it's an "Operation: Carnage" shooter, not a "Smash TV" shooter.
