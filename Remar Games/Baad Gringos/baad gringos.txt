Note: if the game slows down, try the other exe file.

A two-player versus game made at No More Sweden 2011. Our words were "confuse", "rest" and "control", but we didn't use them much.

The game's pretty unbalanced and it's technically over as soon as the thief gets 50 points. Therefore it's best to take turns playing the two characters and see how many points you can get as the thief.
