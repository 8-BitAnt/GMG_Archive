This game is free. If someone got you
to pay something for it, let me know.


The controls appear in-game, but if
you are having trouble you might want
to try an alternate control scheme.

These are alternate keys that work 
the same as the default ones:

flap - up arrow (default), X, W
roll - down arrow (default), Z,S
move left - left arrow (default), A
move right - right arrow (default), D
