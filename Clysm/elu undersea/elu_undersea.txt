  a life simulator
  created in 2004 by clysm - http://autofish.net

  this program is free, but you can't sell it.

  I made it using Game Maker by Mark Overmars,
  a program that I can't recommend highly enough.

  instructions: 

  watch what happens, or click your mouse on things,
  or both.

  this is sort of a sequel to another similar
  program that I made about a year ago.

  the first one was just called elu.

  elu means 'life' in Estonian.

  if you like elu, or even if you don't, you may 
  like seiklus, an exploration/adventure game that
  I made.
