1. General Information

  This game is free. You can play it all you want and copy it for other people, but you 
  can't modify it, sell it, or use graphics from it without express permission.

  If you like seiklus and want to support future projects (or persuade me to work on a 
  sequel), you can donate two or three dollars or something through Paypal using the 
  following address. You can also use this address just to contact me.

2. Included Files

  These files are included in seiklus17.zip:

  . seiklus.exe		the game itself (not an installer)
  . seiklus.txt		the file you are reading now

  seiklus doesn't have any music of its own. However, I've included a few songs that I 
  think suit the game and I've configured the game to recognize and play these songs if 
  they are in the same folder as seiklus.exe. As far as I know, these files are all 
  freely distributable in this way. If you know otherwise, please let me know.

  . yoghurtf.xm		"Yoghurt Factory," by Radix
  . rainysum.mod	"Rainy Summerdays," by Radix
  . sanxion.mod		"Sanxion," composed by Rob Hubbard and arranged by Dreamfish
  . believei.xm		"Believe in Yourself," composed by Emax and arranged by Stalker
  . driller.mod		"Driller," composed by Matt Gray and arranged by Warwick Gaetjens
  . puzzlega.mod	"Puzzle Game 3," by Søren Gessele (a.k.a. Front 6)
  . wingsofd.xm		"Wings of Death," composed by Jochen Hippel and arranged by Wire

  These two files allow seiklus to play the included music files:

  . fmod.dll		FMOD by Firelight Technologies
  . jbfmod.dll		JBFMOD by M. Rijks
