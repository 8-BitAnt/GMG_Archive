Q: Where did you get the music for this game?

A: The first song is from a Commodore 64 game called "Rupert & The 
   Toymakers Party." I don't know the composer's name.

   The second song is "It's a Sin to Tell a Lie." The singing part 
   is Brent Spiner ("Data" in Star Trek: the Next Generation). The 
   talking part is Patrick Stewart (Captain Picard). 

   And here's an unrelated song:

   The third song is an excerpt from "Jack and the Beanstalk" by 
   Sharda, from "Children's Disco Musical Stories."

Q: Where can I find the games this is based on?

A: Look up the Johnny series by Sparlatacus (PG Games) at 
   http://www.gamemakergames.com

   Note: The last boss is based on a drawing by Sparlatacus.
