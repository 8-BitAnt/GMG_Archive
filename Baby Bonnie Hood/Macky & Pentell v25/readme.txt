A fan game made by Baby Bonnie Hood
Made using Game Maker v5.0 by Mark Overmars

===========================================


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
(These are just based on Game Maker's system requirements; if you can run
Game Maker and its games just fine, you can run this game just fine too.)

Any decent CPU (Pentium or higher)
Windows 98/2000/NT/ME/XP
At least 32 MB of RAM and 16 MB of video memory
Support for 320x240 resolution, 16-bit colors, and MP3 files
4 MB of free disk space
DirectX 5.0 and up


INSTALLATION
------------
Just unzip the files somewhere; easy enough :P


ABOUT THIS GAME
---------------
This is a small simple arcade-style shoot-em-up fan game, based on the
video game "Twinkle Star Sprites".  Take on the role of the game's two
intrepid treasure hunters and fly across the lands to shoot down enemies
and collect coins, all in the name of scoring high!

This game is (obviously) freeware; absolutely no profit will be made from
this game at all.  Isn't that the coolest? :D

And finally, don't forget to play the original game that this fan game's
based on ;)


CONTROLS
--------
Main keys:
Arrow keys: Movement.
Z:          Fire shots.  Hold down to fire supershot.
X:          Screen-filling bomb.
C:          Up-close attack.

Other keys:
ESC: Immediately exit the game from anywhere, a quick exit if you will.
P:   Pause the game.  Press any key to resume playing.
F12: Take a screenshot.  Screenshots are saved as BMP files.


MUSIC
-----
This game uses MP3 files for its music.  Here is a list of files that the
game uses and where it uses them; they all must be in the same folder as
the game:

music_menu.mp3     - Main menu
music_config.mp3   - Config screen
music_worldmap.mp3 - World map
music_stage1a.mp3  - Stages
music_stage1b.mp3
music_stage2a.mp3
music_stage2b.mp3
music_stage3a.mp3
music_stage3b.mp3
music_stage4a.mp3
music_stage4b.mp3
music_stage5a.mp3
music_stage5b.mp3
music_stage6a.mp3
music_stage6b.mp3
music_stage7.mp3
music_stage8.mp3
music_continue.mp3 - Results screen
music_fanfare.mp3  - New high score

You can use any MP3 file for these (like music from another game or your
favorite song).  These MP3 files aren't required; it's just that if any
of these files are missing, then the appropriate music will simply not
play.
