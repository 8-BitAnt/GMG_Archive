IF YOU GET AN UNEXPECTED ERROR WHEN RUNNING THE GAME IT IS CAUSED BY THE MP3'S. THE FOLLOWING MIGHT FIX IT:
You have to have Windows Media Player associated with the MP3 format.
Having another media player like Media Player Classic associated with MP3s will not solve this problem.
So, you have to open Windows Media Player, and go to Tools > Options > File Types > and check /check off MP3 Audio File (mp3).
For Windows Media Player 11, you'll probably have to place the cursor over the media player after opening it, and press Ctrl-M to make the top menu visible before you can go to Tools > Options > etc.
