X strafes
S switches weapons

CREDITS:

Everything (music, sfx, game, art) is created by Jan Willem Nijman
Programs used: Game Maker 7.0, sfxr, musagi, MSpaint
Thanks to the following shooters: Doom, Doom II, Quake 2, Wolfenstein 3d, Serious Sam and Half-Life



RESTRICTIONS:

I used 4 colors, a 160x144 resolution, and the buttons of the gameboy and tried to use 16x8, 8x16 and 8x8 sprites.
I did not stick to any technical restrictions.



OTHER:

F4 can be used to switch between windowed and full screen.

Your score is saved as an image in the game folder.
Save game loads from area 2.
Difficulty modes increase damage taken, and on hard enemies attack nastier.


This was my ISA school project, we got to choose our own assignment and make it cool.
