The Electric Yo-Yo remake 2004.

 Originally an obscure arcade machine from Taito in 1982,
The Electric Yo-Yo is a strange little game.  My original 
goal was a pixel perfect remake, however I got sidetracked 
playing around with the control system,.results:  you get
a two (2) part remake. 
 The intro is a game that captures the feel of the original, 
not a perfect recreation, but its meant to give all the ppl 
that have never seen the original an idea of what it was 
like. complete these 3 levels and another game program 
will be spawned on your hard drive.
 This second game is called Sub Atomic (or The Sub Atomic
Yo-Yo) and is a further re-remake of the basic game.. 
of course I could not resist the urge to add some to the 
game play,. and stretch the game into something new.
