GMIrrlicht allows you to use the Irrlicht 3D Engine (Copyright (C) 2002-2004 Nikolaus Gebhardt)
with Game Maker.
Look in the provided example to see how you can use the engine with Game Maker.
There's no help file for GMIrrlicht, therefore you have to look at the scripts for
a short description of each function.
You can also take a look at the original Irrlicht help file. 
The names of the GM functions are similar to the original method/function names, so you won't have many problems to use the Irrlicht help file with Game Maker.
Take a look at "Irrlicht-readme.txt" for the license of the Irrlicht engine.
