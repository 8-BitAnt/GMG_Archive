Basic Idea
----------
Caveman Craig is a simulation survival game. Your aim is to grow your cave's population as much as you can, while fighting off predators and keeping cavemen trained. To do this, you must gather food (berries from bushes, or meat from dead dinosaurs), process it inside the cave, and then use the food to breed more cavemen, whom you can teach to gather, prepare, or hunt.

Instructions
------------
You are Craig, a caveman who's just left home and started his own family, where he must defend his cave and ensure a steady flow of food, which allows him to breed more cavemen. There are 3 types of cavemen you can breed - gatherers, preparers, and hunters. The hunters defend the cave from dangerous animals (which also leaves carcasses for gatherers), the gatherers gather berries from bushes and drag carcasses into your cave, and the preparers work inside the cave, processing the berries and carcasses dropped off by the gatherers. To get more cavemen, you need to have prepared a certain amount of food. When you breed a caveman, you must teach them 1 or 2 tasks for them to make any helpful addition to the colony.

As the game advances, you will face harder enemies and more rapid attacks, but you will also be granted bonuses and will be able to produce cavemen quicker. The game ends when Craig is killed by a predator.
