Licence Information
-------------------
Though we are happy to let you redistribute Caveman Craig on another website, such as an Indie Developers Game Website, please let us know before you do so, and follow these terms:

	- You cannot edit, add, or remove any files from the ZIP archive in your own version that you upload.
	- Ensure you acknowledge the creators: Rhys Andrews and Tim Andrews
	- Again, let us know before you put the game up somewhere!
	- Try to keep your eye out for official updates so you too can update your site's version.

This doesn't apply to submitting reviews or your thoughts on Caveman Craig. However, if you'd like to let us know you've made a review on the game, we'd be delighted to read it.

We can change these terms at any time, and you need to adapt to them without our notice. We could make it so you have to run around naked if you play this game, and not tell you... but we won't, obviously.
