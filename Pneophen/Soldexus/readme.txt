Soldexus
A game by Pneophen
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This being my first game, I wanted to create something that follows an action/exploration formula.
Basically a game similar in design to ones I like to play. Although not that big, it should take some time to 
make it to the end your first play though. As for the difficulty, it will probably appeal more to people
who are into very difficult games.
