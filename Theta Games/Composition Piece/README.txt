[Changes]

  v1.1:  Made the game easier


[Overview]

  In this game, you play as a young composer who wishes to compose a piece for a girl he likes.  The game is a short side-scrolling platformer, in which the platforming gameplay serves as a metaphor for the act of composing and playing the piece.
  Don't go out of the view of the screen (i.e. go too far left or right, or fall through the bottom), or you will have to start over.  Also, hitting spikes will cause similar problems.
  At certain sections of the game, a timer will appear under the word "Wall:".  This is to warn you that a wall is approaching.  When the timer reaches zero (you need to time this properly), you need to press <SPACE> or <X> to use a hammer to break the wall.  Otherwise, you will not be able to progress through the game.
