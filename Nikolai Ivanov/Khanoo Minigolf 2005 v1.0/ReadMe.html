version 1.00<br>

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS<br>
The basic requirements to run the game at all:<br>
- Windows'98, ME,  XP, NT4 or 2000;<br>
- minimum 800 x 600 screen resolution at 16-bit colors display;<br>
- DirectX 5 or later.<br>
The game was tested at AMD Athlon XP 1.47 Ghz + 128 Mb  RAM and had a smooth run.<p>

THE GAME<br>
This is a sequel of Khanoo Minigolf and Khanoo Minigolf 2004, earlier creations of Claret Games, made back in 2003. It is clear what the game is about - classic minigolf to the core. You can go for the highscore in single player mode, or compete with a friend in two players mode (at this time by sharing the same PC). You can also practice on particular holes (see the keyboard controls below), so to increase and confirm you skills and precision. Actually the course is not easy at all, you must work hard before start getting the good scores.<p>

HOW TO PLAY<br>
I think it`s obvious that you must drive the ball through the course, using less shots as possible. The limit is 10 strokes at a hole, if you reach it and the ball is still out of the hole, you continue with the next hole anyway. Shooting is easy - just move the putter around the ball to set the direction of your shot, then press and hold the left mouse button to increase the power. When the power is enough in your view, release the button. You may keep an eye on the power bar at the down left corner of the screen, but I`m sure you`ll feel the things intuitively after the first few plays. That`s all!<p>

WORLD HIGHSCORES TABLE<br>
