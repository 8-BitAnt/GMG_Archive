How to play
-----------

The object of the game is to destroy the enemy (Yellow / Blue) base before
the enemy destroys your base.

The game is over when your base is destroyed.  

If your health drops to zero, your ship is destroyed and you must wait five
seconds before returning to the game.

Each level the game gets harder.
  a.  The yellow ship gets faster.
  b.  There are more mines.
  c.  The enemy missile gets more powerful.

Power-ups:

The rotating V shape is the MegaGlue - This will cause all floating blocks to turn
yellow and return to your base.

The rotating G - This adds one additional gun to your ship.  There is no limit to 
the number of guns your ship can have.

The glowing circle - This is the base shield.  The base shield will go to the base
of whoever touched it last.  As long as the shield is small, you can take it, even
if the shield is on it's way to your enemy's base.

Use Glue to:

1.  Make blocks return to your base.

2.  Intercept the missle.  In later levels, this is essential.  
    Use your glue to take over the missles guidance system.  
    The missle will turn around and attack your enemy's base.

Have fun!
