ESCAPE FROM THE UNDERWORLD by Banov

============
INTRO
============
This game was made for Indie Kombat <http://www.indiekombat.com>.  I competed with Andrew Brophy; the rules were that over the course of October 2010, we were each to make a game that used elements of the others' games.  Voting for the games commences November 1, 2010, and if you enjoyed this game then I strongly urge you to show your support by voting for it =)

============
CONTROLS
============
Important controls are given in-game as necessary, but here are some misc. buttons:
Escape or P pause the game.
M key disables/enables music.  Turning music OFF and then ON when underground toggles what song is playing.
F4 enables/disables fullscreen.

Some additional resources:
The Basic Platform Engine by Martin Piecyk <http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~mfp27/platformengine/>
Makes use of ChevyRay's surface scaling code <http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=3142.msg86809#msg86809>
The game uses tsg1zzn's Super Sound System library for Game Maker to play OGG files
