If you use any of the sprites, PLEASE credit their respective authors (located in the Credits.txt).

If I've neglected to properly credit you for any sprites, please contact me at:
supermariokartracers@gmail.com so I can rectify the situation.


*Note*
Game Maker automatically assumes all gifs are already animated,
therefore gifs must not be a strip format (as they are now).
