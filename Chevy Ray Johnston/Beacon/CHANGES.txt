======================================================================
VERSION 1.10 - SEPTEMBER 3, 2009
======================================================================

	+ Fixed tiling issue with certain tiles next to spikes.

	+ Added ambient background track courtesy of Ronan McGrath.

======================================================================
VERSION 1.07 - SEPTEMBER 2, 2009
======================================================================

	+ Spikes now do not kill you if you touch them from the side.

	+ Some more difficulty tweaks made to the later rooms.

======================================================================
VERSION 1.05 - SEPTEMBER 1, 2009
======================================================================

	+ Your progress is now automatically saved each time you enter
	a new room. If you quit at any time (or the game crashes on
	you), you can restart it later and will have the option to
	continue from the room where you left off. Be aware that if
	you choose NOT to resume your previous game, your previous
	progress will be overwritten. I don't really see the need for
	multiple save slots now, but will add them if I get requests.

	+ Tweaked the difficulty in the final two stages to make them
	less annoying for people on their first run of the game. Later
	versions will feature a harder mode, but for now I want	more
	people to be able to play through the full game without	just
	quitting out of frustration and missing the ending.

	+ Cropped the loading image, because I didn't like the extra
	black around the bottom. Minor change, not really worth noting.

	+ Added two new creatures you will encounter, and placed some
	more of the existing creatures in some of the rooms.

	+ Added one new sound effect.

	- Fixed: Escape now actually leaves the pause menu, like it says
	it does in-game.
