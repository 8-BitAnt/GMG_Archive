into the game's development, and to summarize what I learned from that
experience. I have no illusions that this will be interesting to
everyone: the vast majority of you should skip this, it is really only
of interest to other amateur game developers, and probalby not even to
most of those.</span></div>

and told it to me, in late December 2005 in our mIRC channel
(#rpgcreations on irc.esper.net). The idea: a
top-down 1 vs. 1 action game, involving traps. Besides this idea, he
had five portraits drawn (the five characters originally had different
names), an intro (never actually used in the game, you can see it <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/rinku/pic/00089kex">here</a>), and a mock-up screen of the gameplay and GUI (left).</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

      <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

I agreed to make the game for the Game Maker -- our first Game Maker
game (we came out of the dark world of the OHRRPGCE). I agreed because
I could learn how to use the Game Maker by making this game, because I could
improve my game development skills (I'd never made an action game before), and because it sounded like
something that could be made relatively quickly (relative to a RPG or an adventure game).</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

      <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

The game was to be an odd mix of genres: I once described it as Spy vs.
Spy (NES) meets Street Fighter 2 meets Smash TV. With that in mind, we
began the battle to create this game, starting it almost on New Year's
Day.</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>

The first thing we decided on was the aiming system: it would use a
system similar to Magecraft (another Game Maker game) and Tango Strike
(a Multimedia Fusion game), where you use the mouse to aim and fire and
the keyboard to move and trigger special abilities. This system is very
important to Alphasix, and it wouldn't be the same game without it.<br>

      <br>


As I mentioned, Orchard-L had created a mock-up screen shot&nbsp;which was incredibly useful during the first part of the game's
development. The mock-up used the actual graphics that were going to be
in the game (aside from the sprite which was later replaced) and looks
much like how the game actually wound up looking. I highly recommend this and plan to use this idea again.<br>

      <br>


Thanks to the mock-up screenshot and a small (about five page) design
document Orchard-L provided me with, I got the basic mechanics of
moving, shooting, running, and so on, the level and its wallmaps, and
the basic GUI (the life bars, heads up display, timer) set up in the
first few days. The excitement of a new game usually increases my
productivity. Basically what I did was study that screenshot of a game
that didn't yet exist, and create the game that it was a screenshot of.<br>

      <br>


The first major challenge for me was to get the enemy moving, and this
the rest of the first week. The GM comes with path-finding algorithms,
several different kinds, but they're not really full-featured. I did
wind up using them, but I had to experiment quite a bit, and create a
system whereby the enemy alters the pattern it uses every few seconds
(this is necessary to avoid it getting stuck in a simplistic pattern
that the player could take advantage of). I by no means did all of the
movement AI during this phase, but I did get enough that the opponent
would approach the player and then circle him, and go around walls in
his way.<br>

      <br>
During the second week I implemented the game's first (with many to
come) unplanned feature: that the enemy would vanish when he's out of
your line of sight, and that you would vanish to the enemy AI when you
were out of his. This added a bit of complexity to the game and was a
good design decision. I made it so that the enemy would *think*
you&nbsp;were at the last place it saw you, for a few seconds, and then
look for
you, and if it didn't find you soon it'd get confused and start looking
for you at each of the level's "navigation points", walking between
each of them at random.<br>

      <br>


During the third, fourth, and fifth weeks I began adding a large number
minor but time-consuming and necessary features, such as reloading, the
introduction sequence, getting the stage and character select screens
working, getting MOD music working by implementing a dll library,
differentiating the characters in terms of bullet speed and other
charactersitics, making the crates destructable, and dozens more. I had
a large feature list of these and basically took them in an arbitrary
order (because they were a large collection of unconnected features so
no real order was possible). At about this time Charbile finished the
character sprites: there are five characters, and although they're
small (about 20x28 pixels) each character has 88 frames, so this took a
bit of time to get integrated into the game in a fluid fashion.<br>

      <br>


The sixth and seventh weeks were largely spent on "action" AI as
opposed to simply "movement" AI. The AI could now plan what to do next,
and there were a variety of plans it could decide among. The AI of the
game, despite being pretty and sometimes incredibly stupid, actually makes up a huge chunk of
its code, about a sixth&nbsp;of its 13,000 lines or so. I also created a
hidden "final level" of the game at this time (which appears only on
the hardest difficulty), sort of as an accident. I didn't expect four
computer opponents accidentally placed in the same level to actually
*work* as well as it did (true, you could only harm the "actual"
opponent, but I was surprised it didn't just crash or something).<br>

      <br>


Weeks eight through eleven were spent on game balance, and on setting
up "one-computer-two-player" mode, where one player uses the keyboard
and the other the joystick. Once that was set up I played the game
against my siblings, and the human vs. human game was considerably
different from the human vs. AI game. As a result, I had to change a
lot of the balance, and for every change, I had to adjust the AI to
that change as well. I also added a few new features that my siblings
suggested, such as health boxes.<br>

      <br>


Week twelve was spent on improving the frames per second, which
involved a number of tedious optimizations (such as switching from the
Game Maker's tile engine to pure bmp level backgrounds, reducing the
number of invisible walls, and all kinds of other things).<br>

      <br>


Week thirteen was spent writing the NES-style manual, a surprisingly
complex task. I wrote it, and Orchard-L illustrated it. We released the
manual before releasing the game, as a teaser.<br>

      <br>


So during the first three months of production, we created basically
the entire core game. By March's end, the game was basically finished
except for multiplayer coding (or so we thought), we put the game into
playtesting, and we intended to release the game in mid April or so,
after a (hopefully) quick integration of multiplayer code. Victory!<br>

But we had only won that round. From the beginning the idea was to get
this game playable online, so that friends could compete against
eachother across the world. This still hasn't happened, because it
turns out this type of game is very bad for online multiplay, and
multiplay code is notoriously complex. I gave the game to Fyrewulff,
who claimed he had experience with multiplayer coding, to see if he
could get a multiplayer system working within the game. He spent over a
month on it, all of April and a lot of May, and made little to no
progress. When he showed me his progress at the end of that period, he
had basically set up an auto-patching system (which we never used, and
which I didn't ask for), and a laggy multiplayer ball-bouncing demo.<br>

      <br>


During the time that Fyrewulff was working on the game's multiplayer
code, I was playing voice director -- I had the interesting experience
of trying to coordinate a voice-acting team who only knew eachother
online. I'd never been involved in a game with voice&nbsp;acting before, so
this was a strong learning experience. I wrote a list of things I
wanted people to say into their microphone, sent it out to my volunteer
online friends, and then waited, and waited, until they did, begging
every other day or so. After I got all these samples (about a minute of
a person saying each word in various ways), I then had to choose the
best sample, edit them (I used Audacity), using filters to make them
sound better (low pass filter became a favorite to rid the sample of
static sounds). I'm not totally satisfied with the results, but I think
it's okay for an amateur game and my first time making a game with
voices.<br>

      <br>


Deciding that the game was never going to get done in Fyrewulff's
hands, I myself attempted the online multiplay code, beginning in very
late April. I did make significant progress: you could now host or join
a game, talk to eachother in a lobby while waiting to start the game,
choose characters and transmit that information, start a game, and move
around the map, but that's where the troubles came in: despite a lot of
effort I couldn't get the two games to syncronize correctly as far as
bullet hitting was concerned. I didn't know anything about multiplayer
coding, so I never even heard of "dead reckoning" or similar topics, so
I was trying to re-invent the wheel, and couldn't. Only much later did
I read the excellent multiplayer tutorials out there (especially those
on gamedev.net), but by then my taste for multiplayer code had soured
and I was not happy about a *third* re-writing of the multiplayer code
from scratch, especially because the first two attempts had wasted over
a month's time each.<br>

      <br>


Compounding that was this: while attempting to apply a third-party Game
Maker dll to the game (one which handles compression and
resource-loading), the dll malfunctioned and deleted the game. I lost
several days of progress, as well as the game's to-do list and bug
list, which I lost completely. I tried using undelete software to
recover it, but no, they were completely gone. It's partly my fault for
keeping the backups in the same directory that I kept the actual game
(thus the backups were deleted too), but it was still quite the
dismaying experience.<br>

      <br>


So between March and the end of May, we made basically little to no
progress of any kind in the game itself. We recorded the voices, but
that really was only cosmetic, it didn't affect the gameplay. Oh, I
added taunting, which was a neat, and I drastically reduced the amount
of RAM tha game required (300 MB to about 90 MB) by loading files and
sound samples from the hard disk only when needed, but overall round
two was a miserable loss. I was also feeling very unproductive during
this time and there were times when a week or two would go by without
me touching the game at all.<br>

We counterattacked by adding a totally new feature to the game.<br>

      <br>


During about this time Orchard-L and I were engrossed in what I still
consider one of my favorite new game experiences of the year: Shoot the
Bullet, by Japanese independent game developer Team Shanghai Alice.
It's a "bullet curtain" or "danmaku game", in which you have to avoid
waves upon waves of bullets in pretty patterns. So we had the idea for
"bullet curtain" attacks within Alphasix, as special attacks.<br>

      <br>


It was surprisingly easy to implement these, it only took about a week
(in early June) to get the basic system working and another week to
create and balance the 15 different attacks, and I really loved the
results. Without danmaku attacks, this game would be much worse, so in
retrospect I'm glad we didn't meet the original April release date. The
game is two or three times better with danmaku attacks. This is how the
game became Spy vs. Spy, meets Street Fighter 2, meets Smash TV, meets
Shoot the Bullet. (Shown is a screenshot of the very first danmaku attack). <br>

      <br>


In mid-June I experimented with lighting effects using the Luminaire engine (a Game Maker lighting), but ultimately
decided against them. But you can see a screenshot of the game with
lighting effects <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/rinku/pic/00050g07">here</a>. The lighting code is still in the game and I may use it in the future, but currently it's not used.<br>

      <br>


So in mid-June or so Orchard-L and I decided to release the game
without a multiplayer feature, and add that in later on, after we
figure it out or have the will for a third attempt over that mountain.
I put the game into its second and final found of playtesting, and sent
it out to about 20 friends, in preparation for its release.<br>

      <br>


BAM! Lots of complements, but also, lots of complaints, and most valid.
Each new person who played it had an important suggestion to add, I am
really glad I chose such a great group of playtesters. Its balance
wasn't that great, the controls weren't very intuitive to figure out,
on and on. Again, most valid, so I set about addressing each of these
concerns, polishing the gameplay here, improving it there, increasing
bullet speed here, increasing the speed of the thrown grenades there,
and these minor tweaks took a lot of time, much of June and July.<br>

      <br>


The largest improvement was a tutorial designed to teach you how to
play the game -- seems our detailed manual wasn't enough, in-game help
is pretty useful. Though the tutorial actually turned out to be more of
a set of three mini-games than a true tutorial, I hope at least it'll
be useful for introducing new players to the controls in a
non-threatening manner (okay, you can die in the first tutorial... but
in a non-threatening way!).<br>

      <br>


During late July and early August a lot of time was spent upping the
number of levels. 10 really wasn't enough, or so we thought, so we
added 20 more, for a total of 30 -- most designed for multiplayer (human
vs human), so in retrospect it wasn't that important of an addition.
However, it was nice to design my own levels (the first 18 were created
by Orchard-L, and the last 12 by me), it's easier to "see" your
creative role in a game when you see your own levels in front of you,
as opposed to your work being more in the background (code and such).<br>

      <br>


During early August I thought the danmaku were too unvaried, and
decided to triple the number of danmaku attacks in the game (just as I
had recently tripled the number of levels). This was fun, doing the
mathematics of these danmaku attacks and balancing them was probably
the most fun part of creating the game for me.</div>

T</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">hank you for reading through this, even though I wrote it mostly to
solidify in my mind that this game is finally over, for now at least. A
few final thoughts.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

      <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

The game was originally going to be a lot more similar to Spy vs. Spy
than it turned out being. Spy vs. Spy was hiding traps and avoiding the
traps of the other player. The only thing that really remains of that
idea is the line of sight system (where the opponent is invisible to
you if he's out of your field of vision), Alphasix's mine special
ability, and Sixshooter's ability to detect enemies outside of her line
of sight.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

      <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

I'm not really a programmer, but really improved my programming ability
through this game; I continually impressed myself with how fast I was
able to implement something, how fast I was able to identify the cause
of bugs, and how many features worked the first time I tried them
(which almost never happened with me on previous projects). I think the
reason was that I wasn't concerned with *improving* the game, I was
simply trying to implement Orchard-L's vision for the game, so, at
least during the first three months, I didn't over-optimize, I didn't
go on side-tracks, and I usually stayed on the topic of whatever it was
I was trying to implement.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

      <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

As for the game's quality itself, it's fun, but not deep; it's
innovative, but not revolutionary. It's an entertaining retro game that
reminds one of the NES/SNES days. But that was intentional. It was our
first Game Maker game, so we wanted to learn the engine, but at the
same time create something that was more than a learning exercise (you
learn best from things which have a point beyond learning, I've found).</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
      <br>
      </span><big style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);"><big><big><big><big><span style="font-family: Impact;"><small><small><small><small><big>THE GOOD</big></small></small></small></small></span></big></big></big></big></big><br>
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">1.
Combining genres or creating new ones is always
more interesting than creating a game in an old genre. Like Deus Ex
(which I'm not comparing the quality of this game to), we looked at a
bunch of different genres, took elements from several, and wove a
hybrid genre. Traps from Spy vs. Spy, a basic fighting system setup
from the fighting game genre, a rarely used mouse aiming system from
games like Cannon Fodder, a joystick shooting system from Smash TV, and
danmaku
attacks from Shoot the Bullet.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

      <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

2. Creating that early mock-up
game screen. When you create screenshots of a game which doesn't yet
exist, and build the game until it resembles those screens, it
proceeds faster than expected. A corollary: creating a good deal of the
graphics for the game before you start coding it really helps.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

      <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

3. The
playtesters were a great help, I have a great set of friends who are
very knowledgeable about videogames and intelligent folks (most are
skilled artists in varous genres -- novelists, comic artists, visual
artists, and other amateur game developers), their comments on the game
were very to-the-point and helpful.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

      <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

4. Contrariwise, another
thing we did right was keeping the team small. Besides the sprite
artist (who was only involved with that) and the playtesters and voice
actors, it was just me and Orchard-L, and we got along well. This had
several benefits: we didn't have to explain everything to too many
people, "meetings" didn't have to wait on everyone being there,
communication was much quicker than it would have been even with one
additional person, and decisions could be made quickly due to not
having to convince everyone that a new feature was a good idea.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

      <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
5. The geometry I learned in high school (or refreshed my memory with
through the internet) came in very handy for this game: I used it in
many places throughout the game,&nbsp;which wasn't really true of my
previous games. It's really important when coding a
spatical&nbsp;action game to be able to think geometrically.<br>
      <br>
      </span><big style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);"><big><big><big><big><span style="font-family: Impact;"><small><small><small><small><big>THE BAD</big></small></small></small></small></span></big></big></big></big></big><br>
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">1.
A mistake was using 20x20 tiles and 20x24 sprites in 640x480
resolution. Orchard-L was used to OHRRPGCE tile sizes, and recycled a
few tiles from earlier games, leading to the impression (virtually
universal) that the sprites and tiles were too small for the
resolution. This is one of my biggest regrets about this game, but
there's also a small benefit of having sprites that are too small: the
game focuses on the bullets patterns instead of the sprites, much like
spaceship shooting games and "danmaku" games, both of which tend to
have very small sprites.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

We should have built the game from the beginning with multiplayer code
in mind, and I should have much earlier read the various excellent
multiplayer code tutorials that exist online. Attempting to add it to
the game later on, after the game was basically finished, was a very
bad idea.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

3. I didn't like that we didn't use original music for
this game. We did what the Game Maker game Seiklus did: browse through
a MOD music site and pick some music which we thought would work well
with the game. I still plan to replace it if I can get a musician who
knows how to write music in that format, or if I ever learn music that
format myself.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

4. This is not actually a bad thing from the
game's perspective, but I stopped working on two other games in order
to make this game. Everything you create has a cost: and that cost is
what you could have made during that same time period and did not. Was
this the absolute best thing I could have created in 2006? I had other
promising game designs in a partial state of completion that I dropped
to work on this game, and though I now plan to return to those, was
this the right order to create them in? I think it might be, but we'll
never know.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

5. I didn't use "feature locking" at all -- meaning
I continuously drastically changed every little aspect of the game as
an improvement popped into my mind even up until a few hours before
release. This had the consequence of creating a lot of unwanted bugs
and requiring that everything be continuously rebalanced. In retrospect
I should have obeyed the "if it's not broken, don't fix it" rule more
often.</span><br>
