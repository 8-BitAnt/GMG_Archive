This game was created by Matt Thorson.

It is freeware, so you can share it with your friends.

However, you may not host it on the internet, you may only 
link to it at my site (http://www.mattmakesgames.com/), and
if distributed by other means, this readme file must be with
it.

If you enjoy the game, a donation would be incredibly helpful, 
and it would be greatly appreciated if you spread the word 
about my games in any way you can, especially if you're linking 
to them from another site.
