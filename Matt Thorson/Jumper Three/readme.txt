==================================
	      FAQs:
==================================

1. I heard this game is USB gamepad compatible, how do I use it?

	Just plug it in before starting the game!  The default buttons
	are:

	JUMP   - 2
	ACTION - 1
	START  - 10

	To reconfigure the buttons, just go to Options and then Set Controls
	like normal.  You'll have to set the keyboard controls and
	then it'll ask for gamepad controls.

2. The framerate is really low. What can I do to help that?

	Try restarting your PC first. Other then that, go to Options 
	on the main menu and turn particles off.  If that doesn't help, 
	unplug your USB gamepad (if you're using one) and restart the game.
	If that doesn't help it may be an incompatibility with your
	video card. Maybe try updating your drivers?

3. Are these time trial goals really possible!?

	Yes, they all have been tested and are all possible. However,
	if your computer doesn't run Jumper Three at a constant 60
	frames per second, your times will be slightly slower then they
	actually are.  In this case, go to Options on the main menu
	and toggle the Timer option from realtime to frametime. This is
	a less precise timing system, but it will not penalize you if
	the framerate dips.
