					About:

Well....this game was created by me (Mansur Ahmed Usmani). I created it when I was 17 years old. 
This was just one of the many things with which I was occupied during the holidays, before 
counselling for the Engineering Colleges had begun. I made the full game in about 2 weeks!!! 
I hope that you like this game. If you really liked it, why don't you logon to -www.globon.tk- 
and click the ---donate--- button, just to encourage me to continue creating such games?

distribute it in CDs or floppy disks, give it along with magazines, etc. If you are going to 
distribute it through some computer magazines, or in some software collection CDs, please do
