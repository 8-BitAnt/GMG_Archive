Q:-Im a bit confused on how to play this game.
A:-Play the game, study the tutorials, and read the included
starter guide. Be sure you have played the original ONR! 
Visit www.vertigogaming.net to get it.

Q:-I get a canvas error of some sort when I run the game.
A:- This new version 1.4 should help. If not, do the following:

*Restart your computer, defrag if necessary
*After restart, close all programs (virus scanners, etc).
*Now run the game. If it still doesnt work, then you need a 
computer with more memory. Email me at chubigans3@yahoo.com

Q:-I hear no sounds at all.
A:-Almost everything in this game is MP3 encoded. Make sure
you have the latest version of Windows Media installed.

Q:-Can I start a new game without erasing my saved game?
A:-Not in game, no. But you can store the onr2save file 
elsewhere, and the game will create a new one. When you want
to "load" the old version, just swap save files.

Q:-There is an error popup window during the game.
A:-QUICK! EMAIL ME AT chubigans3@yahoo.com! But this game has
been tested, so you should not recieve any problems.
