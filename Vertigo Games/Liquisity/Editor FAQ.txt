---------------------

Liquisity comes with a fully functional Level Editor
that allows you to make your own custom levels & 
challenges, which you can then share on our forums. 

There are new custom levels every week at 
www.vertigogaming.net!

I.) Extensions

The game itself saves these files under these extentions:

__________________________________________________________
.sav- used for saving single player games and backups for 
ingame use.

.liq- used to save editible files of levels so you can work
on them at another time.

.lid- custom levels that can be played but no longer editable.
Upload these files when posting new levels to download.
__________________________________________________________

You save liq files when in the editor mode, and lid files when
"finalizing" the puzzle during test mode.

II.) Creating a level

Once your in the editor, go wild and follow the tips provided 
on the screen. It should be a snap.

Quick key reference:
LEFT MOUSE BUTTON- select an object category or place the object
RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON- deselect category
MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON- delete tool (also in menu)
CONTROL KEY- deselect category
SHIFT KEY- switches objects in category
SPACE KEY- hides all menus until let go
E KEY- goes back to editor (test mode only)
F KEY- finalizes level (test mode only)

There are some rules. No more than 1 cannon and goal allowed on 
a level. Only 3 bubble jets of any type allowed. 

I suggest you ALWAYS save the editible file before choosing the 
finish level option, although in test mode you can always go back
to the editor.

III.) Things to think about

-If you put more than 20-25 spinners/slicers (aside from the circular
bumpers), the game will slow down on older computers due to the 
bubbles that form from it. 

-You only need one switch per type. Example: one bubble off switch
is enough, although you can put two for whatever reason.

-Be sure that if you start the game with the helicopter ball there 
is a way to switch to another type of ball...otherwise the game 
cannot be finished. Same goes for glass barriers...use them 
wisely!

-If your feeling extra generous, include the editible file of 
your completed level when posting them on the internet. That way
people can tinker with it and make it even better.

IV.) Test Mode

Once you select the options and select "create level," you will 
be brought into test mode. Certain things happen here:

-No glass barriers created.
-Goal doesnt work.
-Powerups dont work.
-Challenges are not visible yet.

Once you press F to finalize the level, everything becomes active
again. Be sure to save the editible file first before finalizing 
a puzzle...otherwise, you have to create it again if you want to 
make any changes!

V.) Playing & Sharing levels

You can select a custom level to play through the main menu. 
To load a custom editable level, goto the "Create new level" 
option and load it from the editor itself.

You can post them at the vertigogaming.net forums or anywhere 
else for that matter, of course. We might even have some 
level contests in the future, so be sure to watch our site!

VI.) FAQ

-I can't get the game to run well.
See the enclosed troubleshooting guide.

-When I play the game, there are 3-4 new files created...why?
Some save the progress in your game, others unlock content, 
and still others create in game backups of your files. Don't 
delete them! 

-I still have more questions.
Post away at vertigogaming.net and I will help you as best as 
possible.
