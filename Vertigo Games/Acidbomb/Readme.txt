--------------------

The entire bulk of the game is explained in the Acidbomb manual included with this game.

You MUST unzip this folder for it to work properly.

NOTE: THIS VERSION DOES NOT COME WITH MUSIC. You can download the music seperately
at the Vertigo Games site. It is highly, highly recommended.

For technical help, visit our site at www.vertigogaming.net.

Enjoy the game! I always love feedback if you have any spare time. :)
