---TUTORIAL---
tut1=Welcome to the tutorial. This will explain how to play this game.
tut2=This is the playing field, where the game takes place.
tut3=This is your main building. Protecting it is your main concern.
tut4=Each map takes a preset time. Be sure the building still stands when time runs out.
tut5=This is the number of destroyed enemies. This will be your score for this map.
tut6=However, if the building is destroyed before time runs out, the score will not be saved.
tut7=These are the enemy's planned attack routes.
tut8=Here, enemies appear.
tut9=Here, enemies disappear again.
tut10=In each map, you are given some towers you can use to defend your building.
tut11=And, some money to buy towers with.
tut12=Click on a tower to select it, then click on the playing field to build it.
tut13=Click on an existing tower to upgrade it to a higher level.

tut20=Let's now release a few easy enemies for you to practice.
tut21=Enemies come in waves. Here you can see the characteristics of the current and next wave.
tut22=When this timer reaches zero, the next wave will appear. For now, the timer has been temporarily disabled.
tut23=You can always call the next wave by clicking the next wave button or pressing the space bar.
tut24=This will give you more kills, but increases the risk of not surviving.
tut25=Let's now put things into action. The first wave appeared, and a few extra towers came available.
