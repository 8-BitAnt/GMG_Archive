HUD (Heads Up Display)
This is the information displayed to the right and the left of the level screen.  It shows:

Armor: The upper-left corner is your ship's armor.  If this reaches 0 you must use a continue or it is game over.  Immediately after you take damage, your craft will blink for a short time.  During this time, you will be impervious to further damage.  Note that you cannot collect armor ups while your craft is blinking.

Weapon: The current weapon you are using is displayed below the armor.

Bombs/Torpedoes: Located below the weapon indicator, this displays if you can use bombs or torpedoes, and how many are available.

Score: The top right corner displays the score.

Difficulty: Below the score the current difficulty is displayed.  If it is followed by (AU) that signifies that Armor Ups are turned on (making the game easier.)

Boss Armor: The boss's armor is displayed below the difficulty.  When the grey bar is completely diminished, the boss is destroyed.

FPS: Shows the framerate X/Y, where X is the framerate and Y is the target framerate (as set in the options.)  It is essentially a measure of the speed at which the game is running.  If the top number is equal to the bottom number, there is no slowdown, and the game is running at the speed it should.  If the top number is 0, the game has stopped.



OPTIONS
View:			Toggles between window view and full screen view.
FPS:			Toggles the framerate between 30 or 60 frames per second.  The game is twice as smooth on 60 fps, but it is less likely to slow down on 30 fps.
Background:		Sets the amount of detail in the background graphics.  Lower settings are recommended mainly for slow computers.
Effects:		Sets the amount of visual effects.  Lower settings are recommended for slow computers.
Music:			Turns the music on or off.
Controls:		Changes controls.
Armor Ups:		Turns Armor Ups on or off.  Turning Armor Ups off makes the game harder.
Restore Defaults:	Restores the default settings.



WEAPONS
In level 1 you start with the plasma beam as your only weapon.  Each time you complete a level you unlock a new weapon until you have unlocked all five of them.  Be sure to equip the weapons you want before each level after the first.  You can equip a maximum of three weapons for any level.  A ship armed with just two weapons is easier to use, while a ship armed with three is more adaptable.  Switch weapons during the game using X (default).  Ammo is infinite.  Weapon stats are given for the pair of guns (as opposed to a single gun).  The weapons are:

Plasma Beam - emits a constant beam that focuses directly in front of the craft.  Solid weapon type for a variety of situations.  DPS: 120

Cannon - Fires a powerful blast two times a second.  Excellent against heavy armor.  DPS: 140

Spread Shot - Shoots a wave of 30 bullets over a 30 degree arc four times a second.  Excellent against light armor types in spread formations.  DPS: 120

Whip - Generates three constant rotating energy whips.  The whips are short range, but have a 360 degree angle of effect, and are therefore good for protecting your ship from oncoming enemy craft and missiles.  While they this is in theory the most powerful weapon in the game, due to its widespread nature much of the power is not transfered into damaging the enemy DPS: 360

Homing Shot - Fires 4 homing shots a second.  Great all-around weapon.  Although it has low damage rating, it has a near perfect hit percentage.  DPS: 80

(*DPS stands for Damage Per Second for the pair of guns, assuming 100% of the weapon's power is transmitted into the enemy.  Note that for some weapons, such as the Spread Shot or the Whip, this is an unrealistic assumption, as at least some of the weapon will miss the enemy)



BOMBS & TORPEDOS
In addition to the weapons outlined above, there is also a number bombs and torpedos at your disposal.  Unlike the above weapons, your ship carries a limited supply of these, but they need not be equipped before the level.  Instead, your ship will automatically carry some if the they can be used in the level.  Above ground, pressing Z will drop a bomb that will destroy ground targets.  If your craft is above water, pressing Z will drop a torpedo which will move forward once it is underwater.  One torpedos should be enough to sink any ship, no matter whether it hits the ship underwater or by landing directly on it.  Once a ship starts smoking, it will explode when it reaches the bottom of the screen.  Torpedos already in the water will automatically pass underneath a destroyed ship in case there are more ships behind it (but, of course, a torpedo that lands directly on a damaged ship cannot pass through it and will be destroyed).



ARMOR UPS
When a medium to large enemy is destroyed it may leave behind an armor up, assuming that armor ups have not been turned off in the options menu.  The armor up will be represented by a glowing "A" that moves towards the bottom of the screen.  Collecting the armor up will add 1 armor to your craft.  There is no maximum amount of armor.  Note that you cannot collect armor ups immediately after taking damage.  (You can collect armor ups again once your craft has finished blinking.)



CONTINUES
You get three continues on easy mode, one continue on normal mode, and no continues on hard mode.  When you run out of all your armor you can still keep playing if you have continues available.  The continue will bring you back to the weapon selection menu immediately before the level in which you died.  Using a continue resets your score to 0, so if you would rather save your score in the high score table you may choose not to continue, in which case you will go to the game over screen.  You should probably not attempt normal difficulty mode until you can get through easy mode using one or fewer continues.  Likewise, you should probably not attempt hard mode until you can get through normal mode without using any continues.



SCORE
In Game:
	Damage Score: 1 point for every unit of damage done to any enemy
	Kills Score: X additional points for every enemy destroyed that takes X units of damage to destroy
Level End Bonus:
	Armor Bonus: 1,500 - 300*(# of hits recieved in level).  Cannot become negative.
	Boss Time Bonus: 100 * (80 - (# of seconds to destroy boss)).  Cannot become negative.
High Score Tables:
	There is a high score tables for each of the six difficulty levels.
	They are easy, normal, and hard with armor ups, and easy, normal, and hard without armor ups.



RECOMENDED WEAPONS LIST
You are encouraged to try different combinations of weapons for yourself and develop your own preferences.  This is mainly a guide for people who have reached a level they have not reached before.

It is important to keep in mind that 2 weapons are simpler to control than 3.  While it may not seem to make much of a difference, under the pressure of heavy fire such simplicity can be very helpful.

Level 1
Laser

Level 2
Cannon, Laser

Level 3
Cannon, Spread

Level 4
Cannon, Spread
Laser, Whip
Cannon, Spread, Whip

Level 5
Cannon, Spread
Laser, Whip
Cannon, Homing
Laser, Spread, Whip
Cannon, Spread, Whip

Level 6
Whip, Homing
Cannon, Whip, Homing
Cannon, Spread

Level 7
Whip, Homing - It is highly recommended that you take the homing gun for this level.
