********Lunar Base 1.0*********
*******by ArKano (2007)********

Lunar Base is a simple tower defense game.
The objetive is to defend your base against
waves of enemies as long as possible.

You can place turrets in the map, making a maze
so that the enemies take longer to dissappear. Turrets 
are upgradeable, and often it´s better to have 
a few powerful turrets than thousands of weak ones.

The game has 50 waves and 4 types of enemies:

-Blue enemy: Normal enemy. Shoots from the Frost turret
will slow them down.

-Red enemy: Slightly thougher than blue ones. These can´t 
be slowed down.

-Green enemy: Slightly faster than blue ones.

-Yellow enemy: Flying enemies, they disappear soon but they
are very weak. Only Minigun and Missile turrets are capable
of damaging them.

Turrets:

-Minigun turret: High-speed/weak turret. They´re cheap but they
can become powerful through upgrades.

-Plasma turret: Medium-speed/normal turret. They´re relatively 
cheap and upgrade well.

-Frost turret: Medium-speed/normal turret. Slightly weaker than
plasma turrets, these turrets slow down the enemy.

-Missile turrets: These turrets are powerful and have a big splash 
range, but they are expensive. Thay also have an enormous shoot 
range.

-Spark turrets: These turrets always attack the first and the last 
enemy several times. They can become insanely powerful 
through upgrading.

-Fire turrets: These turrets attack several enemies at once. They have 
small fire range.
