All music, sprites, backgrounds and other assets used in this game is 
copyrighted by Yal. Do not steal them or reverse engineer the executable (they
took a hell of time and effort to make! And I'm not even getting paid for it!)!
If you would like to use any of the resources, send me a PM on the Game
Maker Community and ask nicely. I might allow you to use the resources (and
send them to you) if I find you worthy.

==============================================================================
Game made with Game Maker 8.0 Pro, altough it uses Lite functionality only.
(Excluding draw_text_color(), which is used only to make nice-looking menus)
Just so you know, GM Lite has potential in the right hands. ;)

Music composed using MilkyTracker, converted to MIDI by MODPlug Tracker, and
polished with JAZZ Midi Sequencer 4.0 free version.
