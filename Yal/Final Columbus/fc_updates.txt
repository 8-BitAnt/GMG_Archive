==============================================================================
Final Columbus - Updates				Game (C) Yal 2010,2011
==============================================================================

==============================================================================

I've put a lot of passion and time into this game. Do not steal its resources,
do not reverse engineer the executable. If you ask me nicely and give me
proper credit (my username Yal and a link often suffices), I may share the
things with you. If I find you worthy, that is.

==============================================================================

Note note note! Save files from version 1.2.x are NOT compatible with version
1.1.x save files! Same vice versa! Sorry about that, but version 1.2.0
required a lot of extra data to be saved in the file. Trying to open files
that ain't compatible will MESS UP YOUR DATA. Not reccomended.

Do not hack the save files until you've beaten the game at least once - 
it may ruin the fun. Save files are not encrypted or hex-coded; this is
intentional; I like to hack savefiles myself.

==============================================================================

======================================================================
What is new in version 1.2.15?
======================================================================

 - Did multiple cutscene changes; many of them quite small pieces of
   dialogue polish, but I also removed some of the bLAM potential in
   the first Smith battle by removing some of Crys' unnecessary lines
   and making Crys show up in the short sequence where you play as
   Smith.

 - Added a new enemy type: Ribbon Whirr. Also known as OMG LAZORS WHIRR!!
   Have fun!

 - Added a new enemy type: Rotoshark Cannon. Remember the enemies in the
   first dungeon? Have you seen any improved version of them since back
   then?
   ...Guess why you haven't? Because I've saved the best enemies for the
   end of the game!

 - Blood drops now has a special variable for how much HP they restore
   when absorbed, meaning that now some enemies' (or friends'?) blood
   will restore more HP than normal blood will. Might be useful on
   Hardcore where blood restores 0.01 HP per drop normally?

 - The cutscene where Smith and Crys show up in the subway will now work
   properly even if you save Ashley - I've removed the trigger to the old
   cutscene that didn't work and totally screwed up the new cutscene.

 - Finally drew a facepic for Jennifer. Better brag about it here so
   I won't forget that when I fix up that W-i-P dialogue sequence.

 - Added some more rooms to the Base, and now the hidden switch
   actually does something.

 - Added some more rooms to the Base. Now, the Oilnuke upgrade actually
   gives you a bit of challenge, with the combination "precise flap-jumps"
   and "BLAZING LAZ0RS!" filling a large room. Oh, and did I mention
   that the entire room is filled with Green Waste, too?

 - There's now a new hidden area called the Canal Junglira.
   Meta-Jungliras will show up during Jennifer's Story, too, but the
   canal area? Perhaps it's just a normal secret area for people
   who love to explore.

 - Or perhaps not.

 - Added 2 more rooms to the Canal Junglira, one being the main room
   of the Meta-Junglira Core Zone.

 - Added some decorative waterfalls in the Water Tower. They will also
   flush you downwards mid-jump, so beware. And have fun climbing.

 - Added a new weapon called "M Launcher", where M is an abbreviation
   which will be revealed once you get it. Invented by Tallie, requires
   a certain event to unlock. Haven't coded the event yet, but if you use
   to hack the save file as much as my friends, you'll get it for sure.


======================================================================
What is new in version 1.2.14?
======================================================================

 - Wasp Swarm ammo recovery items now look like the missiles fired from
   said gun. Might edit the standart-style missile items for all other
   guns too if the update should fall into rime soil (aka you guys like it).

 - Added some big hearts outside the Skull Eater boss room to allow
   players to stock up on HP if took too much damage in the corridor.

 - The new boss battle against Smith is done! It is actually harder
   than the original one, but I'll tone the original one up a bit :D

 - The cutscene after Smith crashes the subway is vastly improved,
   so is the one WHEN he crashes it. Well, I've changed some dialogue
   to reflect the new plot changes, too.

 - Added some more Voice-shading.

 - Fixed some glitches with Engrish Mode, in particular now every single
   occurence of changed strings are changed instead of just the first one.

 - After Simaster's feedback on the reward for beating TOL, moved TOL
   to a completely secret place somewhere else and intend to replace
   it with a Lite-TOL desert area with a different reward.

   The real TOL is still available, but I will NOT tell anyone where
   it is. THE FIRST 3 PEOPLE WHO FIND IT WILL GET STATUES IN TOL.
   PM me a screenshot of where the entrance is and tell me roughly how
   you look / how you want your statue to be.

   I will give you ONE SINGLE TIP to where the TOL entrance is:

    - It's near a save point.

 - Optionettes now will stay more close to you, meaning that whoever's
   last in line won't get her bullets deactivated when you're going
   forward at high speed.

 - Going to the Sleeper Bay won't trap you anymore; moved some tiles
   blocking your way up quite efficently.

 - Vital Information I signpost in Heart Of The City won't infinitely
   loop anymore (accidentaly placed a collision trigger instead of a 
   survey trigger at the signpost)

 - Fixed some dialogue things in Water Tower to avoid fridge-logic
   moments erupting.

 - TOL:Escort Maze is now an actual maze, of gargatuan proportions and
   filled to the brim with hell's finest. And yup, you STILL have to
   escort two low-HP girls trough the maze.

 - Oh, and the copter landing zones in said maze will now vanish after
   one use.

 - Smiley Cog will now chase you when you ride a copter, and normal
   rats will too.

 - Coin Rats will now drop more money, especially on higher difficulties.

 - Added obscure art references.

 - Finally begun working on changes in the scene where Smith destroys
   the ceiling.

 - Bauta Snake will now hopefully stay inside the screen and not get
   deactivated when just the head is outside.

 - Added Thunderblocks for no reason at all other than to make it look
   like there's more hidden areas than there are. Or did I?

 - Fixed BoltBlocks not being solid (facepalm!)



======================================================================
What is new in version 1.2.12?
======================================================================

 - Fixed SUPER FATAL minor glitch with Tallie disappearing from Fungi
   Cave if you didn't talk to her post-shopkeeper. Would block you off
   from entire plot from that point on!

   If Tallie won't show up properly, enter the last room in the Cave
   (final fungibrain room, the one which needs fireblocks to enter and
   has those snakes in it) and leave; she'll show up at the exit now.

 - Added some more enemies and rooms to the Heart Of The City.
   Yup, for the sole purpose of making it easier to get lost.

 - Added some new stuff around Sunshine's hidden room so that it's now
   not that obvious where to look after her. Most notably, there's an
   obvious hidden area full of lava that actually has a new room to
   access; you won't find the lava suspicious anymore and likely miss
   out on the hole in the wall... unless you have sharp eyes.




======================================================================
What is new in version 1.2.11?
======================================================================

 - Added the reward(s) at the end of That One Level.

 - Killing an enemy with your wings gives you twice the normal XP
   it would give you. Risk vs reward.

 - Smiley Gears now die in a more satisfying way to reward you for
   grinding down 20 000 HPs without getting hit even once.

 - Fixed a minor glitch with Skull Eater not fading out boss music
   properly (since it fades out the OLD boss music and not the new one)

 - Added a new room to That One Level: "Boss Run - Special Skull"
   Special Skull has 50 000 HP and rewards you with over 9 000 XP when killed.
   And you will have to fight it every time you enter That One Level!

   Good luck on finding out its weak point. And good luck surviving all
   the anti-blood, too!

 - Added the possibility to chicken out of That One Level. Literally.

 - Thunderbee splash damage now deals a lot more damage.

 - Fixed graphical glitch with laser beam in TOL: House Of Awesome.

 - Added some blocks in the first part of TOL: House Of Awesome to
   make it easier for players without infinite wing flaps to survive
   the first few Smiley Gears.

 - Added some blocks in TOL: Escort Maze ot make it possible to get to
   one of the landing sites after getting out of the copter.

 - Added a door I'd forgotten about in That One Level. Whew.

 - Fixed Vanessa chat showing the wrong face.

 - Fairy Heart shots now have higher attack power (I forgot to double
   it before...) and as well the shots will now fire water triangles in
   two directions when they burst.

 - As well, the bubbles should now cover you better verically.

 - Different clothes will now change Mario's face in dialogue boxes
   instead of displaying the standard one.

 - Drew sunshades on the sprite accompanying Zeddidragon in Special Thanks
   in the credits.

 - Added some more rooms to the Military Base (hidden street) to depthize
   the plot a bit more. Go check them out, will ya?

 - Removed getting the Thunderbee early leading to you missing out on the
   Cain & Emily hovercoptering scene, since I feel too lazy to code the
   SPECIAL CUTSCENE STUFF that'd lead to later (at the sub-tsunami)
   with having Fox there right now... might be in a later version, though.

======================================================================
What is new in version 1.2.10?
======================================================================

 - Used my newly acquired knowledge about subtractive blend modes
   (thanks again, IMP!) to create shade effects that "cool down" the
   Misty Cave (Basement / Haunted Cave), "heat up" the Thermal Plant, 
   and some other places too.

 - Made invisible blocks a lot easier to trigger.

 - Recolored MoonBlocks to make them more visible in dark areas.

 - Made some design changes in the one big area that uses invisible
   blocks, making it actually possible to get the Chain Core before
   you get wings and double-jumping (there were ceilings obstructing
   some jumps; these have been shortened).

 - Added some more rooms to the hidden Drain area (the one with the
   subtle secret arrow and 4 signposts mentioning other hidden areas).
   There's now also something to obtain in the end. Want to get it?
   Lots of frustration guaranteed! :)

 - The shopkeeper won't laugh anymore when you buy Cryo Sphere or
   Fairy Pistol ammo, saving you time and allowing you to spend money
   on large quantities of ammo for these guns without going through a
   timely and annoying process.

 - Added a newline in "MISSILE DEPARTMENT" to make the word "department"
   appear correctly since my add-newlines system apparently has beef
   with it.

 - Renamed "Golden bee" to "Thunderbee", which sounds cooler.

 - There's now an upgrade that lets your Fairy Pistol charge up ammo
   from air dampness, meaning that you get unlimited ammo for it.
   The Fairy Heart benefits from this upgrade too, obviously, and
   recharges its ammo twice as fast.

 - Golden blocks won't dissipate Hellbreath shots anymore. Same with
   Lichin blocks.

 - Desert Hornet missiles now create splash damage effects, even moreso
   with the Thunderbee missiles, which creates a bigger splash that
   also deals four times more damage. Enjoy sudden improvement!

 - Added tons of extra enemies in the third room of That One Level to
   make the room easier to die in. FWAHAHA!

   It might be worth pointing out that I'm not giving any thought to
   whether the level is possible to get trough or not. I make all the
   jumps possible to pull off so that the level is not impossible per se,
   but that's it.

 - Added two more rooms to That One Level, House Of Radical and
   Breather Hell respectively.

 - When riding the hovercopter and dropping the girls or something, they
   will now create a splash damage when exploding. Mainly for looks, but
   it also allows you to kill monsters with them.

 - Added some blocks in the Canal outside the Missile Department so that
   it's a lot easier to get out if you got to the area without the girls.

 - Added a big subtle arrow pointing out the secret area leading to the Drain
   since nobody has said they've found it yet.

 - Added Raccoon. Tip: Raccoon is in room #192. There's a hidden signpost you
   can only access once (drop girls on breakable blocks during the 2nd
   hovercopter ride in a place where you won't expect breakable blocks but see
   that the blocks are breakable if you look closely) that points out exactly
   where this place is, and you can also notice an enemy placed in a seemingly
   out-of-reach area if you look around the area just before the secret area.

 - Added the Sky Tower area after finally making up my mind about how to access it.
   Tip: you've done this before.
   Currently I haven't placed Vanessa, though. Read on and see if she's available
   in the version you have!

 - Added Vanessa.

 - Added the reward Sunshine gives you after meeting all the protagonists.
   It's actually two rewards, one being cosmetic and the other one being
   game-breaking and highly useful.

 - Patched the hole Smith jumps trough in the Subway so that it's impossible to
   get into the "Fake Secret Area" up there. Since the cutscene are in a separate
   identical room, this shouldn't affect it (but you never know ;))

 - Fixed a glitch about having different clothes would prevent your upgraded guns
   to show up properly, and also making ammo refill non-properly when picking up
   ammo-rockets.

 - Fixed similar glitch with blood.

 - Fixed Misty being stuck in ground in the truck.

 - Smiley Gears now give 1 337 experience points instead of 800, and Big Special
   Rats give 480 instead of 360. 

 - Increased Desert Hornet/Thunderbee ammo acquired from pickups on the higher
   difficulties a small bit (most noticeable on Hardcore).

 - Added some new That One Level areas: Math Lie Puzzle and Escort Maze.
   You'll totally hate me forever for them.

   ...Yeah, you really will. Just gave it a shot.

 - There's a new door in the place where you fall down after the Tower Incident.
   It leads to "Drain Access", which is impossible to get into without the right
   item and without knowing the trick.

 - Copter-basket damage in TOL:EM is lowered and less random compared to Canal
   ditto, to give one-life-runners a bit more fair challenge.

======================================================================
What is new in version 1.2.9?
======================================================================

 - Redrew Sunshine's sprite and face to reflect changes made when I started
   with GEAR-Princess.

 - Added a secret area in the Canal. It's accessible from the second
   hovercopter ride and onward.

 - Placed the Desert Hornet upgrade in a hidden area somewhere.

 - Also renamed said upgrade from "Thunderwasp" to "Golden Bee" as a
   not-really-subtle reference to a certain forum member's liking for bees.
   And explosions. (And build-ups ;))

 - Improved how the Engrishfy Engine handles the word "she", which is indeed
   not really a "he" with a "s" appended in front (leading to some funny
   mistranslations with the s getting sticken to the front of a word that
   shouldn't have an s in front of it).

 - Added two more rooms to That One Level and decided what reward you should
   get if you manage to finish it. (There's two levels of it depending on
   how well you finished the level - more on that in-game if you finish it.)

 - Fixed a glitch about player object getting deactivated when riding a
   hovercopter and getting outside the room.

 - Getting the Golden Bee early should "take time", meaning you miss out on
   meeting Cain and Emily when you've set up the Sandplant. This should
   change some other things too, but I haven't worked with them just yet.

 - Made some changes in the Tomb Of Barukarubu so that it's possible to get
   the Boardgun before you get the double jump (if you manage to survive
   Lv 30 monsters that early on ;)), as soon as you get the Keygun in fact.

 - Made some changes in the place where the Chain Core is hidden so that
   you can upgrade your Handgun as soon as you reach the entrance of that
   place (which is VERY early in the game). Good luck with game-breaking!
   Navigating the invisible block ladder without double jumping will give
   you *l*o*t*s* *o*f* *f*u*n*, I'm sure...

 - Healthbars of you, bosses and Dive Suit girls will now have a blue
   "ghost", letting you see visually exactly how much damage was just
   dealt with that attack.

 - To balance it a bit, now you can buy Fairy Pistol ammo in the shops.
   (-Ammo for a gun you reload in water WTF???) -Um, yeah, you actually buy
   bottles of plain bottled water to pour into it when reloading... Ehm. -_'*

   Obviously, to put the Fairy Heart to any use you need to buy copious
   amounts of water bottles. But they're cheap!

======================================================================
What is new in version 1.2.8?
======================================================================

 - Fixed EXTREMELY PAINFUL glitch with Motion Gun upgrade station thinking
   you had already visited it even if you hadn't, and also added a save point,
   some hearts and ammo, and a notebook with more Ancestor notes in the room.

 - Also added a halfway point save point in the first hidden room on the
   way to the Motion Gun upgrade.

 - Fixed a very visible glitch with sunlight in the third room of the
   Grass Dungeon being cut off by a sunflower.

 - Some minor tinkering to make Rockbabies less unfair (especially the
   projectiles they fire when killed, they do not longer look exactly
   the same as the Rockbabies)

 - Removed some Rockpapas in the tomb to lessen the complete overwhelmeness
   that comes on you in the second room of the dungeon.

   It should now actually be possible to get trough it again. Haven't managed
   to yet due to those damn snakes, but it's fully possible. If you get the
   snakes first.

 - Keygun and Boardgun bullets will now push enemies when hitting them.
   Does not apply to stationary enemies; ememies' speed simply gets
   reflected so that they move in the direction of the bullet.

 - Shooting the Boardgun or Keygun downwards in mid-air now gives you a
   recoil boost upwards. Feel free to abuse!

 - Fairy Pistol shots now uses the Pro-only image_alpha variable to
   simulate the rotation rather than by using an animation;
   this looks smoother and also enabled me to give it a liquiddy animation
   that makes it look more like a focused triangle of water.

 - Increased the chance that a rat turns into a coinrat from one-in-50 to
   one-in-40.

 - The first room of That One Level is now accessible.

 - Made a change in the room preceeding the Skull Eater battle. A save point
   alcove by the door should make you save AFTER the cutscene all the time,
   meaning that you won't see it multiple times. Also added some more goodies
   at the upper path there, to make you stray away from Cain instead of
   running into the scene before he gets to the door.

 - A certain Mr.McFungi doesn't show Ninja's face when talking anymore.

 - Improved Oil Nuke traction; now the big bullet won't always bounce
   backwards as soon as it hits the floor. Why that was a feature instead
   of a glitch boggles my mind a lot.

 - Oil bullets should now linger a while when hitting floors/walls and
   actually be able to hit something.

 - Changed the depth of oil bullets to make said lingering look better.

 - Removed having the Oil Nuke drawing 5 ammo per hit to make it less
   underpowered compared to the other Super weapons.

 - Also made the Oil Nuke bullet heavier than the normal Oilgun shots
   since it is, actually, roughly twenty times their size.


======================================================================
What is new in version 1.2.7?
======================================================================

 - Added internal time-keeping, so that you can see how much time you've
   spent playing on your savefile (it doesn't take time spent dying into
   account, of course - so you'll need to double it manually ;)

 - Added Coinrats, something Simaster has suggested for ages. These are normal
   rats that will steal your coins. Every single rat in the entire game has a
   2% chance of spawning as a coinrat, but there's some that will always be
   coinrats. Can you find them all? ;)

 - Removed the henzious grinding exploit in the Hidden Desert Area where you
   could exploit Wingsnake collision detection to get a bunch of defenceless
   snakes stuck in a wall, then kill them all with your wings.

 - Keygun will now have knockback, which might be useful when fighting some
   enemies. And on top of that it makes it feel more like a proper shotgun.

 - Oil Nuke will now only drain 5 ammos per shot instead of 10. It should
   now actually be useful.

   Main reason: killing multiple enemies with one shot spouts one Level Up
   message for each, even though you maybe only levelled twice, which will
   freeze the game for a long, long time if you killed thousands of snakes.

 - Hearts dropped by enemies will move with the same speed as everything
   else during the subway train ride.

 - Tallie will now show up in the windshield of said subway train.

 - The wagon will now clearly stick to the engine with the help of magnetism.

 - The background during the subway train ride has been improved, now sporting
   a slightly better perspective to boot. The train isn't "made outta paper"
   anymore. Oh, and the old background had actually sticken around since the
   VERY FIRST versions of Final COlumbus without getting its much deserved
   update.

 - Reworked the tileset even more, reducing the amount of colors and
   making the metal blocks even sharper (and thus prettier). Also
   added shading to the grass, remade some tiles like cross-bar box
   that are part of all level tilesets and have been around unchanged
   since 1.0.0.
   A.k.a; REDREW THE ENTIRE FUCKING THING FROM SCRATCH. Hopefully the
   result further enhances the gameplay and all that stuff.
   It'd better do... or I'll know it.

 - Redrew Mario's face and also updated the icon.

 - Spent tons of additional time to make the Truck Interior prettier.
   Hopefully pays off in the end.

 - Also started to work on the backgrounds, making them sharper and less
   blurry-1.0.0-screenshotty.

 - REPLACED THE BLOODY SUCKISH DAMN BOSS FANFARE THAT I'VE MISSED FOR AGES.
   Sorry about any inconvenience/ear aches it may have caused.

 - Reworked more character graphics. Jack, Ninja, Garland and Emily now
   have new sprites. Cain's odd haircut issue has been solved.

 - Minor improvements in hanging Tallie/Fox/Emily dive suit sprites.
   In particular, Tallie now has stuff on her shoulders and the strange
   dark gray things has been removed - I think that was originally the
   air bottles worn on the backs, but I'm not sure. Anyway, it's gone.

 - Al's coffee machine should now show up properly when he wakes up Mario
   after he eavesdrops on Voice/Ninja after killing the skull eater.

 - Reworked the intro flashback graphics. Blurrier, slurrier and more
   dithershadowing has been added - and George's eyes, in fact!

 - Redrew the background of the Heart Of The City; it's now the 3rd largest
   background after the sky background and the cityscapes.

 - Skull Eater now wears a skull, walks towards you, shoots fireballs,
   and his cohorts are slower and more possible to actually evade. As well,
   his HP is doubled and he is a bit smaller and with lower gravity.

 - Small birds, Roosters and Flying Roosters have gotten new sprites,
   making them more detailed and more evil-looking.

 - Reworked Ninja's face. Apart from making his scar look better, he's now
   also looking more asian as a bonus!

 - Reworked Albert's (Coffee's) face a lot. Most important, added eyebrows.
   Also did tons of other random stuff, like making him look a bit older
   and wrinkly, improving the shading blah blah blah etc.

 - Reworked Tanuki. Now looks better.

 - Skull Eater's room now has a few more platforms you can stand on during
   the battle, making it less "spam and hope you survive". As well, the
   rats that fall from the ceiling now won't get deactivated and then fall
   down at you in obscene numbers; and they move a bit slower. As well, they
   have lower ATK and drop more gore when shot.

 - Adjusted dialogue faces a bit, too. In particular Ninja's face.

 - Improved sprites of Electric Ball and the Cave-Turret thingie that's the
   first enemy you run into who use them.

 - Homing Thunderwasp missiles won't home Tanuki anymore since they
   got seriously messed up when the Tanuki warped around.

 - Minor changes in drum layout at Outside Truck to enable cover-shooting at
   the rats. Needs some testing to see if their jumping can work unhindered.
   Also added two more rats and aligned some rats to the drums properly.

 - Added/moved some nice stuff to encourage player to get it while Cain goes
   ahead, into doors. Makes you don't ask yourself the question: "How did he
   get here ahead of me when I walked trough the door first???"

 - Added some more rooms in the Fungi Cave. Both are duplicates apart from the
   enemy/item layout. One is there to give you some variation from the vertical
   rooms the cave is mostly based on, another is there to make the path to the
   Motion Gun upgrade a bit longer (previously it was a mere room, now it's a
   two-room hell filled with antiblood and homing roosters!).

 - Redrew the Spinshield Turret thingie in the Haunted Cave, and also gave it
   a blue palette: same as the tiles. It should stand out a bit due to its
   electric pulse thingie though.

 - Redrew the Stray Dog (aka "Polar Bear"), it's now a lot more wolflike.
   ...Um, well, or more bandicoon-like to be precise. -__-*
   Heck, it just looks better. OK?

 - Redrew the Gatling Gun. Once I realized that just because it shoots 5
   bullets at once it doesn't need to have 5 barrels, I managed to give it
   a much, MUCH nicer design in a jiffy. Give it a shot! [/badpun]

 - Redrew our little friends Smugla and Mr.DROP, a.k.a obj_pillar and
   obj_pillardispenser. More mean, but most important more clean.

 - Redrew the Big Toxic Rat, too. Restretched the Small Toxic Rat sprite,
   added scars and stuff, and also stayed more true to the palette this time.

 - Redrew the "bullet bills" and the "blasters", making the former more sharklike
   and the latter more cool in general. Both have retained their red-eyed look.

 - Redrew the backgrounds of the Water Tower, making nice brickwall pixel-art
   for them, with uber delicious missing bricks and stuff!

 - When hovercoptering and Tallie or Fox dies, their corpse will now appear where
   they smashed into a wall instead of at their normal hang-at-copter position.
   As well, they now create more blood drops when crushed against a wall.

 - Foam Shell now creates more bubbles, they may move faster, and they have higher
   gravity. All of these should make the Foam Shell a better weapon, and it's also
   more balanced with the Gatling Gun and the Revolver.

 - The revolver now does more damage, and the description is improved.
   "Shoots in straight a pattern" replaced with "Shoots straight".

 - Epic Whirr is now dubbed "Epic Whirr" when defeated the first time, it will
   move around faster and sooner, and its shot will create a tail.

 - Improved some dialogue. Tallie and Fox at the Tower, Smith's debrief #2,
   Ninja's badass tips in the Truck.

 - Improved lines in the scene where Emily is about to be crushed by a wall.

 - Fungeroids (butterflies surrounding Fungers) now have a much smaller
   collision mask, so when they get stuck in the floor they won't be able to hurt
   your feet unfairly anymore.

 - Changed the font from Palatino Linotype to Garamond after discovering that
   my new computer displayed Palatino Linotype differently, looking uglier AND
   messing up message boxes at the same time! It was quite annoying indeed.

 - Emily's improved sprite now has proper images for looking up and down.

 - Balanced Epic Whirr some more, now its bullet has a tail making it easier to
   see where you can slip under it. As well, its shields deal less damage, and
   they are closer to Epic so that you won't always get hit by them when jumping
   over bullets on the right-hand side of the boss room.
   (And remember, the shields only show up on Intended and Hardcore)

 - Redrew Mario's face AGAIN, this time managing to get the face sprites in the
   same style as the other faces, making dialogue look better. But didn't update
   the icon this time around.

 - Added "Engrish Mode" as a little bonus. Uses scrambling on text to make
   it broken, some parts (i.e., menu text) are also remade by hand.

   Until the "Extras" menu are up and running, perform the Konami Code on
   the title screen to unlock Engrish Mode for the duration of temporary.
   (Use "A" and "B" letter keys, not the F.C. "Accept" and "Decline" keys)

 - The BGM/SFX Volume options new uses a new symbol for the value bars.
   This is due to me changing fonts.

 - Lessened the max speed when swimming, in particular the falling terminal
   velocity. The girls also have a lower max speed, making them a lot easier to
   get with you and removing the annoying bounce thing when trying to get into
   a tunnel. They also won't just stop in mid-water and start to bleed for no
   reason anymore.

 - Scarred Bream now has more HP and moves around more. It should now feel more
   like a boss, even though it's a lot easier than Epic Whirr.

 - Fixed a small collision checking issue.

 - Palm Trees now have an unique trunk tile.

 - Roosters will now home in on you even if you're riding a Hovercopter.



 - Put short, TONS OF STUFF has been improved.

What is new in version 1.2.6?
======================================================================

 - Fixed serious door bug with x values messed up in the subway.
   If you got trapped, you know which one I'm talking about. Gone now,
   so just load your file and go left like you intended.

 - Fixed more spriting. In particular, most people are now taller
   than Mario.

 - Albert ("Coffee") now has a new sprite: he's a lot taller and also
   has more facial details. 

======================================================================
What is new in version 1.2.5?
======================================================================

 - Mario now has a new sprite and hopefully doesn't "look like an
   octopus" anymore. Mainly reworked his hair. Oh, and now his scarf
   is indeed green, just as his mugshot suggests.

 - Cain's sprites has also been reworked. Fun fact: Cain has about
   twice as many sprites as Mario.

 - Also updated Tallie's sprites (luckily, just three of them this time
   -_-*). Perhaps I'll get around to draw new sprites for everyone
   sooner or later, but the three most important characters deserved
   new sprites this instant! Oh, and yeah, George's sprite got perfect
   the first time I drew it, so he won't get a new one.

 - Updated Fox's and Voice's sprites too. Voice now looks fatter and
   has her hair in a haircut that matches her updated facepic, Fox
   has better face shading in general and wears her whitecoat open
   so that her belly is visible.

 - New music for the subway: "Escalation".

 - Reworked some parts of the Fire Pipes. More space, more corridors...
   more filler, to an extent. But as always, pretty fun filler.

 - Added a long corridor in the Subway, to make the long distance you
   actually travel inside it seem longer. This also makes the area a
   bit harder because of the antiblood. Players will have a good
   opportunity to master the strategy pacing themselves and snipe down
   enemies from a safe distance. Or farm Birds to get healing blood.

 - Redrew the subway train sprites. Gosh, the improvement is staggering.
   You really don't even want to know how the old ones looked, I
   tell ya!

 - Added a secret area in the Fungi Cave. Now it's possible to go there
   and get the Motiongun upgrade legally. As soon as you find it. It's
   hidden real well...

 - Fixed some minor issues in secret areas. In particular pits where
   you could get stuck, tiles not being solid or being solid where they
   shouldn't be, and doors leading to the wrong places (such as the
   insides of walls).

 - Tinkered with the text skipping system: sometimes it skipped
   cutscenes/dialogue for no apparent reason. Hopefully resolved, but
   since I don't know what triggers it...

======================================================================
What is new in version 1.2.4?
======================================================================

 - When killing multiple enemies with the same shot, LEVEL UP!!
   messages won't pop up multiple times in a row anymore.

 - Tried to avert the "get stuck in ceiling" glitch. Need to test it a
   bit to see if my fix actually fixes something. I also hope my fix
   won't ruin the improved one-hole-running; the ceiling glitch was
   an unexpected side-effect from that.

 - When coming back from the scene where Smith wakes up in the Tank,
   your equipped weapon now changes to Handgun instead of still being
   the Fairy Pistol you haven't got yet.

 - Jellyfish now move around and look more vivid.

 - Hopefully the girls won't be able to get stuck inside walls during
   the swimming scene anymore; now they move outside walls when
   discovered.

 - Added multiple parts of the Hidden Lab. Including the room where you
   upgrade your Oilgun and the GIGANT LASERS!

======================================================================
What is new in version 1.2.3?
======================================================================

 - Enemy bullets now won't take your Defence into account as much as
   enemy contact damage do. Used to balance out HP/DEF, right now DEF
   even wins over ATK as the best stat, breaking the game since you
   can easily get a DEF that renders even the Triangles and the
   Death Hands unable to deal any significant damage.

   Casual uses a different formula for this, 50% of your defence value
   is taken into account. Other game modes ignores your defence.

   This has also more or less made it impossible to get to Tomb Of
   Barukarubu prematurely except on Casual - which is a good thing
   since you won't be able to progress very far in there without the
   wings anyway.

 - Nearly the same for Enemy Shields: these just use 25% of your DEF
   to calculate the damage they incur.

 - I've gone trough enemy stats and lowered some of them to balance
   these changes.

 - All the final bosses are now immune to the Hellbreath. Otherwise
   the battles would last only a few seconds. And that ain't epic.

   The first two phases of Smith are also immune against your meelee
   wing attack now. It was waaaay overpowered.

 - When reflecting an enemy projectile, it will now get a higher ATK.
   Reason for this is that Mario has around 30-40 HP while most enemies
   available when you've got the wings has at least 250. This should
   make reflected projectiles actually able to pish out some damage.
   The projectile will also move a bit faster and get vertical momentum
   reflected: thus it will move back the way it came, being more
   versatile.

 - Updated chatter and debrief scenes that occur just before going to
   the Water Tower.

 - Minor changes in entrace to one secret area. TOO well hidden <_<.

 - There is now a hidden conversation with Ninja if you go to the Drain
   prematurely using Damage Jumping. Also added a few more Roosters to
   facilitate (if not encourage!) Damage Jumping in said area.

 - There's now a few tile blocks that should make it possible to
   leave the drain without your wings - they are removed when you come
   to the drain after the swimming scene.

======================================================================
What is new in version 1.2.2?
======================================================================

Now it's time to fill the game with various extra content, like bonus
dungeons, hidden weapon updates, and two more hidden endings. Guess if
I've waited for this moment... ^_^

 - Replaced "Golden", the 2nd try of bonus room music, with a new one
   called "Golden Battery, after trying with "Sneak" as the theme.
   Still not 100% sure...

 - Added a secret area that require you to "walk on top of the ceiling"
   in a certain underground or tunnel area. Has hints to other secrets,
   as well as another secret area, that leads to ANOTHER secret area!

 - Added a room between the tunnel leading to the water tower and the
   inside of the water tower: the OUTSIDE of the water tower. You can
   now see for yourself how damn immense the place is before going
   inside it.

 - Fixed a glitch with "unknown variable showmoney" error popping up
   with the Epic Whirr cutscene.

 - Fixed a glitch with a wall at the Secret Stree not being solid.

 - Fixed a glitch with the game crashing if you were at the same x
   value as a Zombie when colliding with it (image_xscale zero error).

======================================================================
What is new in version 1.2.1?
======================================================================

PATCH TO 1.2.0, MORE OR LESS:

 - On Hardcore difficulty, Jars and Cash Piles will still never show up,
   but now there's XP crystals in their places. Picking these up will
   increase your XP a bit. This will make all the previously useless
   areas that only had stat boosts get a little less useless, even if
   the XP gain from these crystals won't be THAT much.
   (It's based on how much points/$ the Intended item would give, so
   they drop more the further into the game you are. Hopefully the
   formula won't break the game nor still make the pickup zones useless)

 - Mario now actually enters the door when the Voice Scene starts.

 - Hopefully Mario won't get "stuck on the ground" when you manage to
   pull off a jump ON THE PIXEL (literary), I've replaced a certain "> 0"
   with a ">= 0" to prevent this.

 - It should now be a lot easier to run over 1-tile-wide gaps.

 - To prevent extreme spammability of ATG Laser and Desert Hornet, now
   only the Revolver will go to "can shoot" mode when the fire key is
   released, as opposed to all of the weapons in 1.2.0.

 - Now you can get the Fairy Pistol upgrade even if you have the Super
   ATG Laser. I had mixed up ammo flag values. The music in the lab with
   the upgrade machine has also been changed to Petra instead of the
   music from the Flooded Cave.

 - During the Smith's Perspective scene, now the sprite and name should
   work correctly instead of instantly reverting to Mario.

 - New icon! Close up of Mario's face replaces the old image that was a
   bit inspired by Cave Story's icon.

 - Removed unnecessary reference to Iji. Not subtle enough.

 - Added a new area called the Secret Street. Accessible from the
   subway exit building, and requires you to get multiple weapons in
   succession to get further and further until you've gotten to the
   last secret it has... fufufu...

 - When you and the girls are going to use the Hovercopter for the
   first time, they won't change back into their normal clothes if you
   go inside the Save Point after they've changed into the Dive Suits.
   As well, Mario will jump out of the hovercopter once Tallie finishes
   the monologue about how to control it: this should allow you to save
   the game if you don't want to hear it again and aren't confident in
   your copter skills (or just want to paint the canal red).

 - Fixed the ugly background issue in the Shop Window. Happened when I
   replaced the old, pixelated gradient with a smoother one.

 - Hopefully skipping cutscenes won't always spawn the Syspause menu
   directly afterwards anymore.

 - Hopefully opening the Syspause menu won't always make you skip the
   next cutscene you enter. (I think those two glitches are linked <_<)


======================================================================
What is new in version 1.2.0?
======================================================================

Version 1.2 has new stuff. Version 1.1.2 and 1.1.1 just had glitch fixes.

 - Added a new scene where you play as Emily right after the rat-busting
   sequence. This partially replaces the long chitchat scene, which has
   been a pet peeve of many of my test players (especially a certain
   Angry Video Game Nerd wannabe that uploaded a "Let's play" video which
   contains more or less silence interrupted by occasional commentary.)

 - Replaced the long and tedious chitchat scene with a shorter one, which
   also has "big sprites" (close-ups) of the characters. Makes it more
   visually appealing.

 - Mecha-Turrets will now shoot gatling gun bullets instead of being the
   most useless flamethrowers in existence. This likely makes them as
   over-powerful as they were intended. So when you find one, you'll go
   ^_________^ - as intended. (Mecha-turrets are on your side, remember?)

 - Fixed critical glitch: if you try to shoot with a gun that has run
   out on ammo, then you will not be able to shoot again until after
   going trough a door, no matter if you change weapons or not.
   (Side effect from code changes when coding weapon upgrades)

 - New title screen, replacing the old black one with white text.
   Now there's backgrounds and big sprites and whatnot.

 - New "Options" screen, allowing you to set preferred screen scale, volume
   settings, and other nifty things.

 - Now ESC won't quit the game immediately; it opens the Syspause screen.
   From Syspause you've now got the option to end the game, and the key
   layout on Syspause screen has been changed too.

 - Now it's possible to skip DIALOGUE by pressing ESC while in a message.
   This will skip all dialogue for the rest of the cutscene, but non-dialogue
   things will still happen. Easier for me to code. Imagine what would happen
   if the entire cutscene code was skipped, including weapon obtaination and
   flag set code. Better having people moving and stuff still available rather
   than risking to lose the imporant stuff.

 - New "How to play" screen, renamed "Primer". Contains 4 pages with
   animated images (yeah, images in general) that explains how to
   play, gives gameplay hints (know thy enemy! Restore HP! Save!)
   and other nifty stuffies. Beats the old one twice or more, took
   about 20 times longer to make.

 - Redrew tons of graphics. In particular the first underground background
   and the Subway background, and most of the "Duh, sharpen and repeat" art
   has been replaced with proper pixel art. My skillz have improved a lot
   since I begun with the game.
   Oh - the tileset has gotten a revamp, too. And Tallie's and Cain's faces.
   And Emily's faces. And some tinkering on other faces, too.

 - Shortened restart delay after dying.

 - Multiple save files. Lore %, HP and some other stuff are shown at
   the file select screen to help you keep track of what file is what.

 - Tinkered some more with the stat boosts. After consulting my TI-82
   it appeared like players would get a total stat boost of 60.75 pts
   (wtf omg 0_o) when they reached Lv.45 - meaning that all stats'd
   be about twice as high as previously!!! Sorry about that oversight.
   Now stuff are balanced so the game won't be too easy; the new
   formula would give you 0.2 + 0.5 + 1 + 1.5 + 1 = 4.2 extra points.
   In each stat, so the total boost is 12.6 points - a bit better.

 - There's now dungeons to visit and collect upgrades for Cryo Sphere,
   ATG Laser, Keygun.
   Upgrades of most weapons will work properly (or at least AT ALL) now.

 - Added a block to enable you to get out of Therm Plant's right-hand
   parts if you somehow manage to enter them too early and save.

 - New music for the title screen, boss battles, swimming scenes and
   boss victory.

======================================================================
What is new in version 1.1.2?
======================================================================

Note: a v1.1.x save file CAN be opened by a v1.2.x game, and actually
the other way around as well. But since v1.2 will be a better game, I
don't recommend doing that. Oh, and since some new rooms have been
added, EVERY v1.2 savefile won't work with v1.1. Just most of them.

Also realize that you may have to rename your save files: v1 may only
open a file called "lc_save.yal" while v1.2 will recognize "lc_save",
"lc_save2", "lc_save3" and "lc_save4". And monitor your progress in
those games in the file select screen as well.

======================================================================

Version 1.2 has various 1.1 glitches fixed and provides a slightly
easier and less annoying experience due to some minor tinkering in
obscure formulas. More ammo and more stat points are there to help you
finish your quest, but just slightly.

 - Tinkered with stat boosts after levelling up. Now you gain more
   points for DEF and ATK, 0.03*level and 0.06*level instead of the
   old values 0.02*level and  0.05*level. As well you get 0.01 points
   in every stat every time you level up. Minor but will stack up.

 - Unique ammunition for each weapon, color coded as well. Should make
   the weapons more useful. Previously ammo restored ammo to your
   equipped weapon which made ammo farming tedious.

 - Enemies drop ammo in the same rate as before, but each item gives
   you more ammo than before (10, 20 and 50 compared to the old values
   5, 10 and 30). Missiles won't be recovered in the numbers 1, 2, 3
   anymore but rather in different numbers depending on difficulty
   setting (1, 3, 5 on Hardcore, 2, 8, 20 on Casual, something in
   between on Intended - 1, 5, 10)

 - Half of the updated weapons now work as they shall (Handgun, ATGL, 
   Keygun, Wavegun). Try to find them all!

 - Various minor graphical glitches destroyed with utmost violence.

 - Fixed glitch with cutscene hangup in Water Tower. Now something
   about Cain's past is revealed properly.

======================================================================
What is new in version 1.1.1?
======================================================================

Version 1.1 has a bunch of patches on the stuff that was bad since I
was so inexperienced when I did it, particularily the intro which
more or less sucked. Especially my spelling back when I did it was
aeons from my current ability. Praise Mozilla Firefox's spell check
and my high activity at the Game Maker Community for the improvements.

 - New intro sequence that gives you more "Early Gameplay" and some
   more backstory about Mario Norris.

 - Revised script in the beginning of the game, spelling errors and
   similiar stuff has been grieviously destroyed.

 - To give Ashley "Voice" Sunset more personality, her face sprite
   has been improved (makeup, more contrast, different hair color) and
   as you'll notice she suddenly has hidden motives (cutscenes has, in
   other words, been added and/or made more visible).

 - Mario's traction has been improved; in particular he won't hover
   one pixel above the ground all the time anymore.

 - Palm Trees in the ending has been even more improved than they got
   the last time I improved them. I also added palm trees in the new
   into sequence. Campfires rule.

 - NPCs will now, after walking, return to their standing image rather
   than just stopping at whatever image they had when reaching their
   destination. This seems to work fine but I haven't tested it 100%
   yet (it lead to a big glitch with NPCs having a sprite with images
   of multiple characters, but I've hopefully solved that by now).

 - Gun-wielding NPCs aren't able to jump in mid-air anymore. That was
   a bug, not a feature.

 - Every time you close a message, Mario won't directly jump anymore.
   This bug appeared since you close messages and jump with the same
   key. Now you have to release it after closing a message to jump.
   This avoids a lot of "loss off immercity" where you jump right
   after an epic moment... it kinda ruins the feelings a cutscene gave
   off.

 - Sound test now allows you to browse Mute Mountain, Petra, and a
   couple of other songs. I've removed the "Bonus Songs" and replaced
   them with some new BGM for new areas that I've added (or will add)
   and as well reordered the list a bit, bringing songs I don't like
   very much to the back and just making a better mix.

 - Added a system that allows you to update your weapons by finding
   hidden items in special areas. Each weapon has a stronger form
   with a cooler skin and name... and improved performance. As you
   may think, I'm gonna add a secret bonus dungeon where the extra
   powerful guns are required to survive... HA HA HAAA!!!

 - Fixed some minor leftover glitches in the last Fungi area.

 - Added some more Jars to buy in the shop (including the Super Jar!)

 - Tinkered with coin's physics to make the code more effective and
   thus reduce lag when tons of them are on-screen simultaneously.

 - Fixed glitch with looping intro conversation.

 - Fixed glitch with one of Voice's cutscenes messing up due to a
   misspelling in the code.

======================================================================
Have fun playing. 						// Yal

Version History
===========================================================================

 - Final Columbus 1.1.2 was released in january 2011.

 - Final Columbus 1.1.1 was released in january 2011.
   Version 1.1 has a bunch of patches on the stuff that was bad since I
   was so inexperienced when I did it, particularily the intro which
   more or less sucked. Especially my spelling back when I did it was
   aeons from my current ability. Praise Mozilla Firefox's spell check
   and my high activity at the Game Maker Community for the improvements.



 - Final Columbus 1.0 was released the day before the comp06 deadline.
   It was complete - a feat in itself - even though I had to cut off
   some parts that'd take too much time to implement. And I didn't
   have time to fix all glitches that had been found. Features 8
   weapons, and a bunch of minor secrets. There's three different
   endings, and the difficulty levels Casual/Intended/Hardcore.

   Oh, and before I forget: Final Columbus 1.0 was made entirely in
   Gm8 *LITE* - this is hard to believe, says some. But you don't need
   Pro to make professional games ;)

   Yal's favourite glitch/exploit in version 1.0:
     While swimming in the Canal after Epic Whirr floods it, in the
     room before the boss, try getting Tallie and Fox caught by some
     jellyfish, and then run for the boss room. (You'll need to pick
     up every single Big Heart you pass to keep the girls from dying)

==============================================================================

I've put a lot of passion and time into this game. Do not steal its resources,
do not reverse engineer the executable. If you ask me nicely and give me
proper credit (my username Yal and a link often suffices), I may share the
things with you. If I find you worthy, that is.

==============================================================================
