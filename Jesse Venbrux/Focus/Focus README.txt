NOTE

On some PC's, when holding down Space and 2 arrow keys, the keyboard won't register all 3 keys.
For this reason you can change the Focus key on the start-up screen to CTRL.

Tips

Use short distance teleports to your advantage. Shorter distance = less energy loss.

Take your time to choose a good position when in Focus Mode.

Sometimes you can simply outrun missiles, or jump to dodge them (even explosive ones).

Anticipate on enemy behaviour and missile paths. When unsure, go into Focus Mode.

Don't fly towards enemies (unless you're sure they won't fire soon).

Learn how to guide missiles to where you want.

Pay attention to the turret trigger sounds.
