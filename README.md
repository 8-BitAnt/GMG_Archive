# 8BitAnt's Game Maker Game Archive

This archive contains many Game Maker Games made in early versions of Game Maker.

(Anything before the Game Maker Studio versions.)

There is no specific category these games fit in and are just random games I've come across and put into this archive.

I am excluding most of the games from the YoYo Games Archive since it's pretty complete but I might put the games from there into here eventually.

Hope you enjoy! :D

Yes, though if you expierence issues please let me know immediately.
