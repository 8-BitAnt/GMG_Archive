# Ant's Game Maker Game Archive

This archive contains many Game Maker Games made in early versions of Game Maker.
(Anything before the Game Maker Studio versions.)
There is no specific category these games fit in and are just games I've come across and put into this archive

I am excluding most of the games from the YoYo Games Archive since it's pretty complete but I might put the games from there into here soon.

Here's credit to other archive that are a part of this one:
