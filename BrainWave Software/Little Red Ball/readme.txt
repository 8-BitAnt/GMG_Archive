ABOUT THE GAME
---------------
The main part of the game consists of guiding a ball
to the end of a short track. There are 8 levels, with
6 to 8 tracks in each course.

To get the ball to the end, you must rotate the world
around you. There are many many different obsticles for
you to overcome. Levels range from very easy to very
difficult. Everytime you complete a level you unlock a 
new mini-game. You will also have the option to turn the
timer off for that level.

I have also included a level editor for you to make your
own levels. If you have created a level then feel free to
email it to me! I will not accept large files, so keep your
levels at minimum file size. If I have the time I may even 
place your levels the brainwave website.

I feel Little Red Ball is pretty much done. Im really getting
sick of working on it. Every now and then I may add some more
objects to the game, but dont expect any more major changes.
Some of these objects may include warp blocks, one way blocks,
movable blocks, and more special effects items.

Will I ever make a sequal? Doubt it. I dont think this game
could be too good a second time around. Feel free to make fan
games! Email me if you do. I would like to see how it turned
out! ;)

Im working on other games right now, so keep checking for updates
at my website!
