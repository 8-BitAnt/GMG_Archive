:BREAKBALL is basically a 3d(ish) breakout/pong/shooter(well..yeah)

See included image 
Key:

1. Shield gauge: 
	Shows your shield energy. When it's gone, game over.
	Your shield decreases by
		a. The Ball (5)  hitting the forewall (closest wall)
		b. The "x" powerdown hitting your paddle (3)
		c. The "!" bomb hits your shield.
2. Score--if your score is the highest, it will be displayed
 	  on the opening screen.

3. Paddle:
 	Move with the mouse
	Use this to deflect the Ball(s) away from the front wall.
	Where the ball hits in relation to the paddle's center
	affects the angle of the ball's movement.
4. Power up/down:
	They spawn at the back of the room 

    "S" powerup:  Lazer shot
	If you catch it with your paddle (3) you get Lazer ready status
	Left-clicking shoots a lazer straight out the center of your paddle.
	Lazers can :
	   	a. Destroy Energy Tiles (6)
		b. Split the Ball (5) into two (9)
	When you are able to shoot the Status area (7) will show you
	and your paddle will change appearance.

    "X" powerdown: moves towards your paddle on its way to the forewall.
		   If it hits your paddle:
			a. You lose your lazer ready status
			b. you lose a bigger chunk of shield strength
			c. you lose 500 points
                   If the "X" hits the front wall, it is destoyed with no 
		   penalty to you.
    "!" bomb.. bounces out and slides on the floor towards you>  can reflect it away from the forewall with your paddle.
			a.causes more damage;
			b.lose 1000 pts
		

    "?" can be 1 of 4 things:
		a. 500pts
		b. lazer shot
		c. split the ball ( up to 3 in play at a time)
		d. inverse>> your paddle moves in the opposite mouse direction
	 
     

5. The ball: Deflect this with your paddle
	a. Decreases Sheild strength (1) if it hits the front wall
	b. destroys Energy tiles (6) in the back of the room.


6. Energy Tiles: destoy these with lazers or the ball (5 & 9)
                 You get points for destroying these; if all tiles are
		 destroyed, then you get a clear bonus and some shield
		 energy back.  Energy tiles re-appear soon after they are
		 all destroyed.

7. Status area: shows if :
		a. you can shoot a lazer
		b. you get a clear bonus
		c. you successfully split a ball
8. FPS
9. Split ball:  this is the second ball that appears if you split a regular 
		ball (5) with a lazer. Split balls act the same as the 
		regular ball, except they move at different speeds and are
		instantly destroyed when they hit your shield. You receive no damage
		if a split ball hits your shield. You can have up to two split balls 
		at a time.

OTHER:

after 5000 points, an energy wall will be added as an obsticle.
The energy walls will try to move and prevent your main ball from
hitting the back wall: they are destroyed on contact with a
ball or lazer shot.
