~~Instructions~~

***Installation***
Place the file "AOOFAD" into any folder on your PC that you want.
The game is self-contained, meaning it wont dump a bunch of extra files
into the folder that it's been placed in.  Nice and tidy.


**Controls***
Use the A and D keys to move left/right
Use W to Jump
Your mouse aims the character's gun. When you click the mouse he will fire
in the direction of the green crosshair.

The animated arrow patterns with the green dashed lines are like jump-boosts.
if you jump into them they will accelerate you even higher.

F5 saves, f6 loads.  USE THIS, it will make your life much easier
If you are hit once, you die. However, you have infinite lives.
