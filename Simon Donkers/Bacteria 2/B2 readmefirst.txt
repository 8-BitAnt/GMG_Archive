 --== Goal ==--

  Your goal is simple. Destroy red in as few moves as possible. When you 
  click a stone, it rotates clockwise. The stone that it points to is 
  converted. For each stone involved, any stone that is either pointed at 
  or is pointing to a green stone will be converted

  The rules are simple. The strategy required is not. 
  Good luck playing the game. 

 --== Controls ==--

  Left click on a stone to rotate the stone clockwise. 

 --== Additional controls ==--

  F5: toggle scaled full screen
  F6: toggle 640x480 full screen
  F7: toggle sounds
  F8: toggle voice
  F9: toggle music

 --== Multiplayer matches ==--

  Bacteria 2 also supports a multiplayer match against somebody at the same PC or at the other
  side of the world. A multiplayer match has one extra rule. You have 15 seconds to move or your
  turn will go forfeit.
  If you want to play an online match some extra things need to be done. First, one player needs 
  to host the game. After this player has set up his game the other player can join him. If both 
  players are on the same home network then no IP is needed. For online matches you need to enter
  the IP from the host. Here come's the tricky part. If the host is behind a router or a NAT you 
  need to enter in his remote IP and the host will have to set up port forwarding. See a site like
  http://www.portforward.com/ for more information.
