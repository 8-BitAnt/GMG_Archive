Introduction
------------
The Crypt of Darkness is the first chapter of the Gythol Granditti series. You play as Geoff Dandy, your average lout who gets dragged into adventuring by his friend of many years, Dolph Dombardo. Tor Borgh, Geoff's hometown, just hasn't seemed the same as it used to, and it's up to them to find out what's going on with the small village.

Quick Notes
-----------
The start-up loading time for this game is quite long, so be patient, it will eventually load. Machines with a 1 ghz or under will likely experience 30-60 second loading.
The F1 key disables and enables music in game, turning music off speeds up the game.
The escape key quits the game, you are asked if you want to quit when you do so.
Default controls are the arrow keys for movement, Z for action, X for cancel, and C for inventory (and will skip the first cinema in the game).
Wells are save points in this game, you can save at any well.
The cancel key is run when out of battle. You can toggle it on or off.
Fast mode in the options menu diasables some graphical effects and runs the game faster for computer that cannot run the game well.
Supports a joypad / joystick for controls, along with custom controls. You can change the controls in the options menu. Plug your game pad in before loading the game to let the game recognize it.
It's advised you set the options, like controls, or screen gamma, before you play for best results.
If you're stuck in the game, be sure to talk to the town locals. There's a lot of them and they have good advice on what to do next.

Gamepad Controls Note
---------------------
If you assign your controls to a gamepad, you navigate even the start menu with it. If you no longer have your gamepad or cannot use it for any reason, delete the file "controls" in the directory of the Gythol Granditti game. This will reset the settings to default allowing you to use your keyboard to play. Alternatively, the 8, 4, 2, and 6 keys on the numpad can be used to navigate to the options menu, and keyboard button a, b, and c are action, cancel, and start menu.

Make sure to plug in your gamepad BEFORE you load the game or it will not recognize it.

----------
Game Hints
----------
There are many characters in the Tor Borgh area with lots on their minds, so be sure to talk to them. They can help you determine what to do next, gossip about town happenings, give you advice, rumors and hints where secrets may be, and in some cases they may even throw an item or a few crowns your way. In the event you are stuck in the game and don't know what to do, there will at least be a few locals who will point you in the right direction, so just ask around.

Make sure you distribute the use of Holy Cheese among your characters. It's a good idea to do this not only so all your allies are statistically matched, but the only way to gain skills is by leveling up your characters. Be sure to do the same with equipment, having your most powerful character die will surely spell doom for the rest of the team, so spread out the crowns you spend on equipment for every character.

Be sure to save often, you don't want to get caught off guard by a battle after you have done a lot of progress, only to die and have to start over again. You can save your progress at any well.

Each character has their own weapon they use and skill set. Many enemies can be a lot less dangerous by using certain skills, character combinations, or battle strategies, so plan ahead and you can make dispatching foes a lot easier.

-----------
Performance
-----------
Minimum Recommended Requirements
OS: Windows 98 and above (eg. 2000, NT, XP). Some versions of Win 95 can run the game.
Processor: 300 mhz Pentium
RAM: 128 MB
Hard Drive Space: 10 MB

Anyone with 1 ghz or over should not experience any performance problems. If the game runs choppy, or in some case, gives an error when loading, first restart your machine. Then it's best to shut down all uneeded background programs, like anti-virus software, any open windows, IM programs, etc. Then in the game options, enable fast mode. Pressing F1 while playing the game will toggle music on and off, playing with music off speeds the game considerably on slower machines. Lastly, unplugging a game pad, if you're not using it, can also slightly increase performance.

-------------
Battle System
-------------
When a battle commences, characters with higher agility are likey to go first. When it is your turn you can do a few things, move, use an item, perform a skill, or attack. You can either move and perform an action, or simply perform an action. Once you attack, use an item, or perform a skill your turn ends, even if you didn't move.

Turn order is determined by agility, but it is not a round system. Faster characters can go twice before some other characters do. The higher agility you have also means the further you can move. Every 40 agility points equates to 1 movement square.

When attacking, it is best to attack from the back or sides of your target to increase acuuracy, damage, and critical chance. The same applies to your character, so when moving keep in mind which direction you are facing.

Make sure you plan before you go into battle and be prepared. Have a few healing items, and be sure to use skills when an oppertunity arises. Some skill combinations and battle tactics can be particularly effective against some enemies, and especially bosses.

------
Status
------
Every character has a various number of stats and attributes -

Name - The characters name.
Class - The characters battle class.
Weapon Class - Which weapon the character can use.
Armour Class - You can only equip armours of equal or lesser weight to this.

Hit Points - Determines how much damage you can take before being eliminated.
Skill Points - You can only use skills if you have enough SP to do so.
Attack - Determines how much damage you inflict on foes.
Defense - Reduces physical damage you recieve.
Skill - Improves skill damage dealt and reduces skill damage taken.
Agility / Movement - Determines how far you can move and quicker turn order.
Attack Range - Weapon range. Determined by the weapon you have equipped.

Skills - Every skill has a different effect, and SP usage. Take note that skills involving the character attacking (eg. Needle Strikes or Cleave) are inflicted as physical damage, not skill damage. Skills like Lighting Bolt or Flame Blast inflict skill damage.

To improve character stats, you can buy (and sometimes find) better equipment. You can equip them via the Status menu in the Start Menu. You can permanently increase stats by using a Holy Cheese on your character via the Level menu. Using one advances your character a level and allows you to choose an extra level to be added on a stat you specify (HP, SP, ATT, DEF, SKL, AGL).

-------
Options
-------
You can use most keys as controls with some exceptions. Escape is the quit button, and cannot be changed. You can use a joystick / joypad to play the game, to do so, make sure you have it plugged in the first slot of your computer (should be at the front), then simply use it to set the controls.

Make sure you set all the directional buttons correctly. Up should be Numpad 8, Down should be Numpad 2, Right should be Numpad 6, and Left should be Numpad 4. Only 10 joystick buttons are supported, so if your joystick / joypad has over 10 buttons (not including the direction pad) it won't recognize them all.

Gamma can be adjusted for monitors that do not display the game correctly (too dark, too bright, one shade too bright), increasing all three of the gamma level simulates brightness for darker monitors too, and darkens on lower levels.

Dialog speed is merely cosmetic, all dialog can be skipped by pressing the action key if it's too slow.

Fast mode turns off some graphical features to run the game faster.

-----
Extra
-----
There are 15 peices of Holy Cheese in the game, see if you can find them all. They can be found at the end of the game if you did miss them, so you don't need to restart if you didn't find them all before beating the game.

There's a few situations in the game where you can get extra items, change the outcome, or see certain situations play out. If you already beat the game once, you might want to try playing it again, this time a little differently and changing where you go and what you do.
