Hopefully you are having a "blast" (snicker) with EC:HC2! But if your having 
problems with the game, this is the file to read.

I. MP3/Sound Problems
----------------------

Q: I hear sound effects, but no music or voices...whats wrong?
A: This game uses MP3 effects for all music and voice effects. If your 
computer does not support mp3, download a newer version of your media
player, or dowload Winamp for free at www.winamp.com. Having the music
in this game is a BIG part of it, and you will lose the "full effect"
of the game if you choose not to fix the mp3 problem. TRUST ME.

Q: The game pauses frequently to load sounds.
A: A defragging of your computer needs to be done. Clean out any temp
files afterwards, and you should be good to go.

Q: I hear the music, but no sound effects (like explosions)!
A: This happens when you run separate applications when the game is 
running. Close the game, then try playing the game again. Restart your
computer if the problem persists.

Q: I hear the music and sound effects, but no voices.
A: Your media player needs to be updated. It does not support the 
different mp3 file types. Before you update, try restarting your 
computer.

Q: I've tried everything...EVERYTHING...and I can't get the music to
work, or the voices.
A: Get a new computer. Or make sure your media player is up to date 
(Windows Media Player 9)

II. Other Errors
----------------------

Q: I get a weird "kernel" dll error when I try to start the game.
A: This is the fault of your computer, and not the game. Restart your
computer and try again.

Q: The game crashes when I try to load it.
A: Try shutting down your system, and restarting it. If it still crashes,
see if your computer supports mp3, and update your media player.

Q: The game runs slowly.
A: There are multiple ways of fixing this. If you use a NVIDA driver, update
it to a version 44.03 driver. The game now runs fast. Be sure your computer
is not running anything over 16-bit color by going to Display-Settings.
Don't run the game in 24 or 32 bit color. If it still runs slow, defragment
your hard drive. Make sure no other programs, like a virus application,
is running while the game is running.

III. Game Errors
----------------------

Q: There is an error that asks me to abort or ignore...
A: Impossible! If this happens, email me at chubigans2@yahoo.com. This game
has been tested many times by different people. 

Q: Can I start a new game without deleting my old game?
A: Just find the file "menusave" in your EC:HC2 folder, and copy it somewhere
else (must be another folder). Then start a new game. If you ever want to play
your old game, move the new menusave file somewhere else and put your old save
file back in the EC:HC2 folder. 

Q: I had a saved game, but I started a new one accidentaly! 
A: Too bad. You should be more careful! There was a warning before you started
a new game...did you pay attention?

Q: How do I pause?
A: F1 key.

Q: How do I save my game?
A: The game saves after every important action, such as a new level unlocked
or when you spend some tokens/earn tokens. Don't worry, the game takes care of 
saving :)
