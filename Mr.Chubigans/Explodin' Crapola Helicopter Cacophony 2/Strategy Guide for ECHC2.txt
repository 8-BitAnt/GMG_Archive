II. Quick Kills/Tips
----------------------

-Always use your bombs and missles when your NOT using your bombs 
and missles. Example: Throw a missle at a helicopter, then get close 
enough to finish him with a bomb to the hull. 

-Always hold down that gun button when your shootin' enemies, except in
hostage situations.

-Its faster to take out ground units with missles and gunfire, but more
dangerous. Its slower with bombs, but safer.
 
-Try to stay slighty away from heavy attack helicopters when firing upon
them. If you stay far enough, you can hit him, but he can't hit you.

-ENEMY bombs can still damage buildings if they hit the road without 
impacting an enemy.
