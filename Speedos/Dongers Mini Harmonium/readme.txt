1. Introduction
Hello and welcome to Dongers MINI- Harmonium. Harmonium is an exclusive Dreamworld instrument that has been used in the lands of magic for years. It is intricately designed to give the feelings of love and harmony to your very soul and pertain good thoughts.

2. Controls
By clicking on different keys, you emit different harmonic pitches. Give it a try! By pressing one of the buttons on the top of the screen, you can also switch modes. There are five in total. You can know what mode you are playing by the text displayed on a black bar on the top of the screen. There is also an accompanying image.
You can also use the keys on your keyboard. To play piano keys, you can use Q, W, E, R, T, Y/Z, U, I, O and P. To switch modes, use the number keys- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
