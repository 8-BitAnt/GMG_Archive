Welcome to another lands of games feature!
You get to dress up my hand however you want.
Drag the different dressing pieces around and see for yerself!
Right click deletes a piece. Click on the top left icon resets all the objects to their original positions.

Game created by Juraj "happy hippie" Kusenda
Theme song: Oddroom - Bright Glitch DnB Theme Piano (from opengameart.org)

I hope you enjoy this fun little game and feel the same mystic aura as I did while creating it :-)
